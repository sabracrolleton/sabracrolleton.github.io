Она позволяет получить на выходе документацию приемлемого вида. К недостатку сустемы @b(Codex) можно отнести то, что формирование шаблона документации не выполняется автоматически. Указание на включение разделов документации, относящихся к отдельным сущностям к которым можно отнести: @begin(list) @item(системы ) @item(пакеты )@item(классы ) @item(функции, setf-функции ) @item(обобщенные функции,методы, setf-методы ) @item(макросы ) @item(и т.д., и т.п.)@end(list) приходится формировать вручную.

It uses Postmodern to communicate with the database. The basic idea is that you create your classes in the metaclass DB-CLASS and submarine cares about creating SQL tables or, if the tables already exist, checking if they conform to the provided specification.  Moreover, Submarine supports an intuitive way of expressing both one-to-many and many-to-many relations.  - Removed in Oct 2021 Quicklisp Update                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

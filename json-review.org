* Introduction
The common lisp eco-system with respect to Json libraries has changed since the first edition of this review. The second generation of common lisp json libraries is actually quite exciting. It still remains the case, however, that your choice of datastructures for your application may drive your choice of json library and vice versa. Like everything else in life, there are trade-offs to be made and I hope this paper helps you think about what may or may not be relevant for your situation.

** Common Lisp Encoding and Decoding Libraries
Common lisp currently has at least twelve libraries that address importing and exporting json data. The libraries considered in this report are listed in the table below. (For purposes of this comparison, I will refer to "encoding" as converting from common lisp to JSON and "decoding" or "parsing" as converting from JSON to common lisp.)

- (1) IMPORTANT: Notice the github location has moved. Hans Huebner's old github location will automatically redirect to Phil Marek's, but quicklisp is not (as of the time of this writing) pulling code from the new github location.
- (2) trivial-json-codec seems more targeted at decoding from json to CL than serializing to json. Its main purpose is in serializing json data to CLOS hierarchical objects.

<<quick-summary>>
* Quick Summary

As can be expected, the libraries do much of the same if you have basic needs. However, differences exist and should be considered in choosing which library is right for any particular project. Many applications are asymmetric in how they will use these libraries, so consider the strengths and weakness given the needs of your case. Library links are to the libraries' individual sections below.

- *Overall:* I quite like the newcomers [[shasht][shasht]] and [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]]. [[Jonathan][jonathan]] would be there unless you start running into decoding the types of larger json data sets which cause it to go into slow motion. [[cl-json][cl-json]] and [[yason][yason]] are still the work horses if you need fine control, but speed is not their forte.
- *Parsing Speed:* Speed is not everything, but seems to be important to a lot of readers. If you are parsing compliant data and are just looking for speed, look at [[jsown][jsown]], [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] (not in quicklisp) or [[shasht][shasht]]. [[jonathan][Jonathan]] is faster on tiny strings but starts to slow down with nested objects and eventually, depending on the size of the json object, becomes orders of magnitude slower than the other libraries. See [[read-times][read-times]]
- *Encoding Speed:* If you mostly need to encode lisp data to json and are just looking for speed, I would look at [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]], [[shasht][shasht]] or depending on your data, [[jonathan][jonathan]] or [[st-json][st-json]]. See [[write-times][write-times]]
- *Unicode Handling:* Most of the libraries can handle unicode. However, if you have unicode surrogate pairs, you need to choose from [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]], [[jonathan][jonathan]], [[json-streams][json-streams]], [[jsown][jsown]], [[shasht][shasht]], [[st-json][st-json]] or [[yason][yason]]. See [[decode-unicode][Decoding Unicode]].
- *Extracting Subsets:* If you want to extract a subset of json data without paying attention to everything else, [[jsown-filters][jsown]] is the choice. [[jonathan][Jonathan]] allows you to get a key:value pair, but I could only use it one level deep. Obviously every library can import all the json data into some CL datastructure and then use standard CL functionality to get whatever subset you want.
- *Handling all proper json forms:* I think [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] is the winner, unfortunately it is not in quicklisp if that is a requirement.
- *Handling potentially invalid data:* See [[standard-conformity][Standard Conformity and Dealing with Malformed Data]]. I think [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] is the winner, unfortunately it is not in quicklisp if that is a requirement.
- *Proper Distinction Between NULL/Nil/False:* [[com.inuoe.jzon][Com.inuoe.jzon]], [[shasht][shasht]] and [[st-json][st-json]] get it right out of the box. [[jonathan][jonathan]] and [[yason][yason]] provide the ability to get there with setting a simple variable.
- *CLOS Abilities - Decoding:* [[trivial-json-codec][Trivial-json-codec]] can decode objects to standard pre-defined classes. [[boost-json-decoding-to-clos][Boost-json]] can decode json objects to a boost-json:json-object which is a standard object. [[cl-json][Cl-json]] has the ability to decode json objects into a "fluid-class" CLOS object. (Note, this is thread unsafe if you have not already prepped classes for every expected json object. If you define your own classes with a lispclass member, this can be avoided so long as every class is defined that way.) Personally I prefer being able to define my own classes. Trivial-json-codec then just dumps the json data into your classes. If you use [[yason][yason]], I would also use the helper library [[json-mop][json-mop]]. ([[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] decodes json to hash-tables, so does not have decoding to CLOS abilities out of the box.)
- *CLOS Abilities - Encoding:* On the encoding side, [[cl-json][cl-json]], [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]], [[shasht][shasht]] and [[trivial-json-codec][trivial-json-codec]] are able to encode CLOS objects to json out of the box. The rest of the libraries require that you write your own methods for your clos classes - which is not necessarily that difficult, but not something you get out of the box. If you like [[yason][yason]], there are two helper libraries: [[json-mop][json-mop]] or [[herodotus][herodotus]]. I have a preference for [[json-mop][json-mop]] with the caveat that, at the moment, you cannot redefine classes. There is also a [[cl-json][cl-json]] helper library, [[define-json-expander][define-json-expander]], which defines classses which can be used by cl-json to help move data back and forth.
- *Encoding different lisp types:* [[shasht][shasht]] and [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] were the best at encoding different lisp data types. For example, they were the only library able to handle structs without the user having to define a new method. There is a trade-off between handling multiple lisp types and symmetry. If you do not have a 1:1 matching but rather have a many:1 matching, there may be complications doing a round trip between json and CL and getting exactly the same data type or structure you started with.
- *Incremental Encoding:* [[cl-json-incremental][cl-json]], [[jonathan-incremental][jonathan]], [[json-streams-incremental][json-streams]], [[jsown-incremental][jsown]], [[shasht-incremental][shasht]], [[st-json-incremental][st-json]] and [[yason-incremental][yason]] all have the capability to do incremental encoding. You can see small examples in their individual sections at the links in the previous sentence. I found [[shasht-incremental][shasht]] a little easier. [[jzon-incremental][com.inuoe.jzon]] is actively working on the capability. See [[incremental-encoding][Incremental Encoding Discussion]] for more detail.
- *Security issues:* Security issues are always a potential problem if you are getting data from uncontrolled sources. Malware disguised in the data will likely either be properly formed json strings that try to overload the system by overloading libraries using keywords as hash symbols or improperly formed json strings that exhaust the stack. See the [[security][Security discussion]] for more information. In cases facing data from uncontrolled sources, I would look first at [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]] , then maybe at [[shasht][shasht]] and [[jonathan][jonathan]]. I would suggest that all libraries put some type of limit on parsing depth of json objects or arrays. At this point only [[com.inuoe.jzon][com.inuoe.jzon]], [[json-lib][json-lib]], [[json-streams][json-streams]] and [[trivial-json-codec][trivial-json-codec]] have such limits, all of which are configurable. See [[security][security]].
- *Symmetry or "Round Tripping":* Symmetric treatment is important to some users. In this area, libraries tend to have issues with NULL/Nil/False as well as whether keys should be symbols or strings. Symmetry is easier going from Jason to CL and back. It is definitely harder if you go from CL to Json and back to CL and you do not limit your CL data types. (CL has more data types so you do not have a 1:1 match). Your choices are to limit your CL data types or using libraries which allow you to precisely specify the CL datatype you want at that point. Overall, I think the symmetry winner is [[shasht][shasht]], but your fact pattern may drive a different answer. See [[symmetry][symmetry discussion]].

At the end of the day, your particular data and requirements will determine which library is best for any particular application. Webapps may have tiny bits of json going back and forth while other uses will be asymmetric - gigabytes of json getting imported and little or occasional amounts getting exported or vice versa. You may have different needs depending on whether the json encoded data is strictly controlled or it is coming in from unknown sources. In one test, yason:encode choked on a list which included a keyword :NULL in an unexpected location. Cl-json just encoded it as the string "null" and st-json encoded it as 'null' (not a string). In testing for your use, if you get json data from uncontrolled sources, deliberately feed badly formed data and see how the library reacts. Some will throw recoverable conditions (depending on the error) while others may actually lock up a thread.

- (1) This is cl-json's default mode. Using cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics or cl-json:simple-clos-semantics will switch cl-json into a mode where json arrays are decoded to cl vectors rather than lists, and json objects are decoded to CLOS objects rather than alists.
- (2) There is a difference between how it handles the string false and string null and how it handles them when they are in an object and not separated as sub-strings. See [[true-false-null-mapping][true-false-null-mapping]].
- (3) All four libraries that decode a json object to a CL hash use strings as hash keys by default
- (4) yason:parse has a keyword parameter :json-nulls-as-keyword and a keyword parameter :json-arrays-as-vectors.
- (5) Parsing json value strings which are not embedded in a json object or array will trigger errors. For example (jsown:parse "12.3") or (jsown:parse "alpha") will trigger a sb-kernal:bounding-indices-bad error in sbcl. Floats in an array or object will be converted to a ratio:
  #+begin_src lisp
    (jsown:parse "[123e-1, 15.2]")
    (123/10 76/5)
  #+end_src
- (6) While shasht and yason default to parsing json objects as hash-tables, they can optionally be parsed as alists or plists.

The following tables set out some additional detail on mapping from JSON data structures to lisp data structures using the normal functions listed above with some comments on the results.

*** True, False, Null, Empty Array Mapping
Contrary to some people's belief systems that boolean logic encompasses everything, there is a meaningful difference between "false" and "unknown". Null ≠ nil. For that matter, I subscribe to the belief that (not true) is not the same as the empty set. Json's null and empty arrays can track the differences between false, null and empty array. When translating back and forth between CL and json, it is important to be able to keep those distinction. Thank you, com.gigamonkeys.json, com.inuoe.jzon, shasht and st-json for getting them correct right out of the box and thank you to jonathan and yason for giving me the ability to get there with setting a variable.

- (1) The cl-boost author notes in his [[https://github.com/cl-boost/json/blob/main/README.md][README]] that "it is not possible to distinguish between false, null, or []. And, I have personally never found this to be problematic." Obviously your experience may vary. My experience is that they show meaningful differences between "false" and "unknown". I think his position is stronger if the question is solely between nil and [].
- (2) When reading a json object with nil and null, json-streams provides no value for the cons cell which represents the json value false. I would have expected the cons cell to have a value of nil.
- (3) When called with :object-as :plist, the nil is explicit: ("1" T "2" NIL "3" nil)

The following table shows how the various libraries try to decode a json object with an empty array as the value. Com.gigamonkeys, com.inuoe.jzon, json-lib and shasht are the clearest representation of the original json.

- (1) All four libraries that decode a json object to a CL hash use strings as hash keys by default. All four will allow you to optionally use keywords instead. Shasht and yason allow you to decode a json object to alists or plists instead of hashes.

*** Decoding Nested Json Objects
For nested object examples, we will be using the following simple json object:
#+begin_src lisp
(defparameter *nested-address-1* "{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",

    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}")

- (1) boost-json creates a boost-json:json-object which is a standard-object. Accessing the slots is done with boost-json:json-getf and boost-json:json-setf functions. See [[boost-json-decoding-to-clos][Boost-json decoding to CLOS]]
- (2) cl-json can create a cl-json:fluid-class which is a standard-object. Accessing the slots is done with the name of the slot. See [[cl-json-data-to-clos][cl-json-data-to-clos]].
- (3) The st-json "object" jso is a struct, not a CLOS object.
- (4) You need to define your classes first

For example, consider two address json objects:
#+begin_src javascript
  *address-1*
  "{
    \"name\": \"George Washington\",
    \"birthday\": \"February 22, 1732\",
    \"address\": \"Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States\"
  }"

*nested-address-1*
"{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",
  \"address\": {
    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}"
#+end_src

Obviously you can always write your own function to initialize a specific class from an alist, but we do have two libraries (boost-json and cl-json) that try to do something like this for you automagically. Let's take a look.
*** Boost-json
Boost-json will decode the json nested object to a CLOS object class called boost-json:json-object.

#+begin_src lisp
  (boost-json:json-decode *nested-address-1*)
  #<BOOST-JSON:JSON-OBJECT
  {"first_name":"George","last_name":"Washington","birthday":"1732-02-22","address":#}>
#+end_src
It appears like you need to call (json-getf obj keyword) in order to act as an accessor. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((data (boost-json:json-decode *nested-address-1*)))
    (setf (boost-json:json-getf data "first_name") "Michael")
    data)
  #<BOOST-JSON:JSON-OBJECT
  {"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Washington","birthday":"1732-02-22","address":#}>
#+end_src
*** Cl-json
cl-json can decode and convert them to a cl-json:fluid-class CLOS object. You do need to at least temporarily set the change the decoder to use simple-clos-semantics and set the \star{}json-symbols-package* to nil. (Note, this is thread unsafe unless you have pre-created. Per the documentation: "To maintain the mapping between lists of superclass names and fluid classes, the decoder maintains a class registry.  Thus, using fluid objects makes the CLOS decoder essentially thread-unsafe. (If every incoming json Object is guaranteed to have a prototype with a "lispClass" member then there are no fluid objects and thread safety is ensured.)  If the user wishes to employ fluid objects in a threaded environment it is advisable to wrap the body of entry-point functions in with-local-class-registry.")

First, looking at the simpler version, notice you need to specify the slots in the fluid-class object:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
   (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
   (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *address-1*)))
     (with-slots (name birthday address) x
       (values x name birthday address)))))
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {100FB22513}>
  "George Washington"
  "February 22, 1732"
  "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"
#+end_src
Now looking at the nested version, we need to note that by default cl-json will convert the underscores in the json keys to double hyphens in the slot names.
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
   (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
   (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
     (with-slots (first--name last--name birthday address) x
       (values x first--name last--name birthday address)))))
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {10107CF9E3}>
  "George"
  "Washington"
  "1732-02-22"
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {10107CF6F3}>
#+end_src
Because we have a nested class, we would need drill down and specify the slots for the sub-object as well:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
   (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
   (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
     (with-slots (first--name last--name birthday address) x
       (with-slots (street--address city state country) address
         (values x first--name last--name birthday address city))))))
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {1010E69B93}>
  "George"
  "Washington"
  "1732-02-22"
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {1010E698A3}>
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src
*** Trivial-json-codec
If you have defined your classes, trivial-json-codec does make it easy to decode json data directly to a vector of your classes. Suppose we have a simple person class:
#+begin_src lisp
(defclass person ()
  ((name
    :initarg :name :initform "Sabra"
    :accessor name)
   (eye-colour :initarg :eye-colour
    :initform "brown"
    :accessor eye-colour)))
#+end_src
If we have a vector of json objects which are all data for a person class, we can automatically build a vector of persons by specifying the class we want to use:
#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((data
          (trivial-json-codec:deserialize-json "[{\"name\":\"Claudia\",\"eye-colour\":\"blue\"},{\"name\":\"Johann\",\"eye-colour\":\"brown\"}]"
                                               :class (find-class 'person))))
    (name (aref data 1)))
  "Johann"
#+end_src
There is no magic if the json array has objects of different types.
** Extracting a Subset of a json object
Suppose you just want a subset of data from a json file. Obviously every library allows you to parse the entire json file and then use standard lisp functions to pull out the subset you want. Only a few libraries will extract the desired subset directly.

** Determining Object Keywords
Jsown has the ability, once a json object has been parsed into a jsown object, to get the keywords of the object. The following only gets the first level keywords.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:keywords (jsown:parse  *nested-address-1* ))

  ("first_name" "last_name" "birthday" "address")
#+end_src

** Handling NIL
This is a test of how the library function for reading from a string handles nil. Errors are not surprising. What was surprising was shasht:read-json hanging when given a nil.

** Encoding Symbols, Chars, T, nil and :null
<<encoding-symbols-to-json>>
Several libraries have an issue encoding symbols. Typically these can be resolved if you write a method for handling symbols. Of course, if you have symbols in your lisp data, you might want to look at libraries which handle them without any additional effort on your part.

As mentioned when discussing mapping from JSON to CL, there is a problem with null in that it represents "unknown", not false. CL does not have that as a data type, which is unfortunate. You cannot determine, absent other additional data, whether CL's NIL = [] or NIL = False or "unknown". As a result, you really have to pay attention serializing to and from JSON as to what you want nil to represent and whether it is unacceptably overloaded.

The following table uses 'a as the symbol input and #\C as a character input. :null was used as a proxy for null.

- (3) You could write a method to handle this type. For jonathan, see [[jonathan-encoding][jonathan-encoding]]. For st-json see [[st-json-encoding][st-json-encoding]].
- (4) You can use the helper library [[https://github.com/stablecross/cl-json-helper][cl-json-helper]] to encode nil as "false".
- (5) Using yason to encode a symbol would require the use of yason:encode-symbol-as-lowercase rather than just the simple yason:encode
<<encoding-ratios>><<encoding-numbers>>
** Encoding Numbers
There are no surprises in encoding integers. Floats are generally fine depending on your view of rounding and the use of exponents. Ratios get slightly more interesting. Json-streams and trivial-json-codec were the only libraries to refuse to encode a ratio number. Json-lib wrote it as the string "null". The rest converted it to some form of digital number. The following table uses 9/4 as the sample data.

- (1) Succeeds if the hash-table keys are strings, fails if they are symbols
- (2) Invalid results if given a list inside the hash-table or errors if the hash-table keys are symbols
- (3) The basic json-stringify function does not handle data structures, so you need to resort to more complex calls. See [[json-streams-encoding-hash-tables][json-streams-encoding-hash-tables]] or [[json-streams-encoding-arrays][json-streams-encoding-arrays]] for examples.
- (4) May be able to resolve if you write a specialized method.
- (5) Automatically handles standard CLOS objects and also allows you to specialize
- (6) Invalid results Sample output on a simple nested array looked like: [,"Cork","Limerick"][,[,"Frankfurt","Munich"]]
- (7) You need to write your own st-json::write-json-element function for arrays.
See [[st-json-encoding][st-json-encoding]].
- (8) Typically for these objects jonathan requires extra keyword parameters like :from :alist
- (9) May require using one of the more specialized functions such as encode-alist etc.
- (10) jsown is the only library which can handle multi-dimensional arrays

<<encoding-lists-to-json-summary>>
** Encoding Lists (Summary)
By default, all libraries except json-streams:json-stringify (which does not accept lists) and trivial-json-codec (which generates invalid json) will return a json array when provided a plain common lisp list. Some libraries will not accept non-keyword symbols in a list (or will need an additional parameter). If you need to keep the key-value connections of a plist, you may need to convert the plist to another form or use a more specific function. More detail can be found [[encoding-lists-to-json][below]], [[encoding-plain-lists-to-json][plain-lists]], [[encoding-alists-to-json][encoding alists]], [[encoding-plists-to-json][encoding plists]].

In general, plain lists and plists are returned as json arrays unless some other keyword parameter is provided. If the library handles alists, they may be returned as json objects enclosing arrays, arrays enclosing arrays, or other variations. See [[encoding-alists-to-json][encoding-alists]] for more detail. Please set the footnotes to see if libraries have issues with symbols (including keyword symbols).

- (1)  com.gigamonkeys.json, json-lib cannot deal with alists directly. Consider using alexandria:alist-hash-table to convert the alist to a hash table.
- (2) Symbols are allowed only if they are keyword symbols, otherwise com.gigamonkeys.json will error.
- (3) Plists are treated the same as plain lists and will lose their key-value connections. Convert to a hash table first.
- (4) Symbols are allowed only if they are keyword symbols. Json-lib will convert a non-keyword symbol to null.
- (5) If it is a plain list or plist, yason:encode and yason:encode-alist will not accept symbols in the list. If it is an alist which has symbols, it will accept them as keys if you run (setf yason:*symbol-key-encoder* 'yason:ENCODE-SYMBOL-AS-LOWERCASE) first. Otherwise it errors.
- (6) Json-streams:json-stringify does not accept lists as input. You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].
- (7) Fail - the json arrays are invalid. They have ',.' or ',' rather than ':' depending on whether they are dotted cons cells or not.
- (8) As you might expect, plists are treated the same as plain lists and will lose their key-value connections. If you want to keep the key-value connections, you can either convert the list to an alist or hash-table or use the cl-json:encode-json-plist function.
- (9) This function is plist specific and will error if provided an alist.
- (10) If the alist has dotted cons cells, jsown and st-json triggered unhandled memory faults with sbcl 2.1.11-x86-64-linux, ccl version 1.12.1 LinuxX8664 and ecl-version 21.2.1. This appears to be because jsown and st-json have optimized the code and assumed that all lists will be proper lists. The assumption obviously fails in the context of dotted cons cells.
- (11) The *-alist functions require an alist. Shocking, I know.
- (12) com.gigamonkeys.json will assume a plain list is a plist, returning a json object with key-value pairs. If the length of the list is odd, the final value in the list will be treated as a key and an empty set will be inserted as the value.
- (13) For jonathan to properly handle alists, you need to add the additional keyword parameters :from :alist
- (14) Trivial-json-codec is going to give us invalid json from now on with respect to tests involving lists - e.g. '(a b c)) becomes "<A,B,C>", so we will drop it from the rest of the encoding tests involving lists.

** Encoding Plain Lists
As noted above, if you had symbols in a list, libraries like json-streams and st-json are going to error out because they need additional methods, while com.gigamonkeys.json accepts only keyword symbols. In the below table, I included trivial-json-codec's results without the error that it generates on ratio numbers. Notice that gigamonkeys is interpreting the list as a plist and trying to create key:value pairs.

<<encoding-alists-to-json>><<encoding-alists>>
** Encoding Alists
I discovered that many libraries have problems if the alist components are dotted pairs (improper lists). So we break alists down between alists with dotted pairs and alists without dotted pairs. We will keep symbols out of the sample data because we already know from [[encoding-symbols-to-json][encoding-symbols]] that some libraries will have issues with alists containing symbols as keys. Of note:

- cl-json provides a function to encode the alist properly as key:value,
- com.inuoe.jzon correctly guesses this is a alist which should be encoded as key:value,
- shasht:*write-alist-as-object provides the ability to write an undotted alist as a json object rather than an array.
- yason provides a specific function to encode the alist properly as key:value,
- If the alist has dotted cons cells, jsown and st-json triggered unhandled memory faults with sbcl 2.1.11-x86-64-linux, ccl version 1.12.1 LinuxX8664 and ecl-version 21.2.1. This appears to be because jsown and st-json have optimized the code and assumed that all lists will be proper lists. The assumption obviously fails in the context of dotted cons cells.

- (1) Fail - the json arrays are invalid. They have ',.' rather than ','
- (2) You may be able to write a new method to handle dotted.
- (3) Only if (setf shasht:*write-alist-as-object* t), which is not the default. Otherwise it generates an error.
- (4) If the alist has dotted cons cells, jsown and st-json triggered unhandled memory faults with sbcl 2.1.11-x86-64-linux, ccl version 1.12.1 LinuxX8664 and ecl-version 21.2.1. This appears to be because jsown and st-json have optimized the code and assumed that all lists will be proper lists. The assumption obviously fails in the context of dotted cons cells.
- (5) You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].

Now we change the data slightly, still using dotted pairs, but with a nested list as the value in one pair: Using '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))) as the sample data.

Notice the difference in the successful results. cl-json and yason's result of {"foo":"bar","baz":[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]} is what I would have expected. jonathan tried to force a key value pair into the second alist value. {"foo":"bar","baz":{"1":[2,3],"4":[5,6]}}.

com.inuoe.jzon is a special case here. It uses heuristics to predict what data structure it is using and this particular sample works because it does not try to make an integer into a key. if the sample data had been something like
#+begin_src lisp
'(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . (("A" 2 3) ("B" 5 6))))
#+end_src
it would have predicated that the "A" and "B" should be keys and would have returned
#+begin_src lisp
"{\"foo\":\"bar\",\"baz\":{\"A\":[2,3],\"B\":[5,6]}}"
#+end_src
which may or may not have been what you wanted.

**** Without dotted cons cells
Using '(("A" 1) ("B"  2) ("C" 3)) as the sample data.

Note difference in results. Some libraries return arrays, others return objects. Some libraries return key:[value] pairs, others return two member arrays.

- (1) Using json-stringify caused the alist used as data to fall through etypecase expression demanding a json-streams:json-array. That means that you have to fall back to more complicated calls. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].

Let's make the value portion of the alist another alist. Now using '(("foo" "bar") ("baz" ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))) as the sample data. The results may or may not be what you want, so look at them carefully.

Yason:encode-alist, com.inuoe.jzon and jonathan return json objects with key pairs; the rest try to return arrays. jonathan seem to be trying to force a key value pair into the baz values when I do not think this is probably what you want. Yason and com.inuoe.jzon's heuristics return the same result. Let's change the data slightly and just look at these two libraries again.

<<encoding-plists-to-json>>
** Encoding Plists
- cl-json:encode-json (returns array) and cl-json:encode-json-plist (returns object). cl-json provides a specialized function to encode the plist properly as key:value
- com.inuoe.jzon correctly guesses this is a plist which should be encoded as key:value
- With keyword symbols, jonathan returns an object, but otherwise returns an array.
- yason provides a function to encode the plist properly as key:value

Using '("a" 1 "b" 2 "c" 3) as the sample data

- (1) Encoding to array but loses the obvious key-value connection.
- (2) You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].

** Encoding Arrays
<<encoding-array>> <<encoding-arrays-to-json-summary>><<encoding-arrays>>

*** Encoding Single Dimensional Vector
<<encoding-vectors>>
Boost-json loses the first value in the vector. Json-streams and st-json do not handle the vector. All the other libraries pass, although some get excited about the floating point number.

- (1) You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].
- (2) You need to write your own st-json::write-json-element function for arrays. Possibly something like:
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod write-json-element ((element vector) stream)
  (declare #.*optimize*)
  (write-char #\[ stream)
  (loop :for val :across element
          :for first := t :then nil
          :unless first :do (write-char #\, stream)
          :do (write-json-element val stream))
  (write-char #\] stream))
#+end_src

*** Encoding 2 Dimensional Array Version
Just to see what happens if we give the libraries a two dimensional array, let's use #2A((1.0 1.0) (1.0 1.0) (1.0 1.0)) as the sample data.

Jsown is the only library to handle a two dimensional array without the user having to write additional methods.

- (1) The hash table encoding is fine. In this example com.gigamonkeys.json is treating the list which is a hash table value as a plist and trying to create key:value pairs.
- (2) You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].
- (3) May be able to resolve this with writing your own method.
*** Using symbol as key

- (1) The symbol must be a keyword symbol or com.gigamonkeys.json will error out. As noted above, it is also trying to treat the embedded list as key:value pairs rather than an array.
- (2) If the symbols were not keywords, json-lib would return "{null: 1, null: [7, 8, 9]}"
- (3) You would need to use lower level components of json-streams. See [[json-streams-encoding][json-streams-encoding]].
- (4) You will need to write your own method to handle symbols in this situation
- (5) May be able to resolve this with writing your own method.
- (6) There is no applicable method for the generic function when called with arguments :symbol

** Encoding CLOS objects
<<encoding-objects>>
cl-json, com.inuoe.jzon and shasht all are able to encode CLOS objects by default. Boost-json, jonathan, jsown, st-json and yason require that you write methods for each class. With the other libraries you would either have to convert the clos object into another type (hash-table or alist etc.) or write a specific function for that particular class of object. We are using a very simple CLOS object here, just to test the water.
#+begin_src lisp
  (defclass person ()
    ((name
      :initarg :name :initform "Sabra"
      :accessor name)
     (eye-colour :initarg :eye-colour
      :initform "brown"
      :accessor eye-colour)))
#+end_src
As you can see from the table below, at least in this simple example, cl-json, com.inuoe.jzon and shasht all are able to encode CLOS objects by default. Boost-json, jonathan, jsown, and yason require that you write methods for each class.

- (1) You need to write a method for each CLOS object.  See  [[boost-json-encoding-clos][boost-json-encoding-clos]], [[jonathan-encoding-clos][jonathan-encoding-clos]],,[[jsown-encoding-clos][jsown-encoding-clos]], [[st-json-encoding-clos][st-json-encoding-clos]] or [[yason-encoding-clos][yason-encoding-clos]].

<<incremental-encoding>>
** Incremental Encoding
Suppose you do not yet have a specific lisp data structure with all the data you want to encode to a single json object or array. A simple example would be intermediate function results during a loop. How would you go about writing it? Obviously you could collect all the results into a list or other CL data structure, or you could build a json object or array incrementally or write them to stream incrementally. Examples can be found in the library details section below using the appropriate links in the following table.

<<symmetry>>
* Symmetry
Are the libraries symmetrical in the sense that (a) going from json to cl and back to json gets you the exact same json and (b) going from cl to json and back to cl gets you the exact same cl data and data structure? (This is sometimes called round-tripping.) This is critical to some users, not critical to others. If there was a 1:1 matching of cl and json data structures, this would be easy, but there isn't. json has a null that cl does not have and cl has many data structures that json does not have.

Consider starting from json and trying to get back to json. To quote Steve Losh: "For me, the most important quality I need in a JSON library is an unambiguous, one-to-one mapping of types. For example: some libraries will deserialize JSON arrays as Lisp lists, and JSON true/false as t/nil. But this means [] and false both deserialize to nil, so you can't reliably round trip anything!"

Now consider starting from cl and trying to get back to cl. A cl library that handles both lists and arrays might encode both as json arrays. But now when you decode the json array, are you decoding to a cl list or a cl array? If round-tripping is important to you, this will drive your choice of cl data structures so that you know what you are decoding back to. Similarly, what do you do with symbols?

** Json -> CL -> Json
*** First test (Easy)
In the first easy test, the only surprises were jonathan reversing the order of the elements in the json object and I do not know what trivial-json-codec is doing with the angle brackets in the json object test.

- (1) trivial-json-codec is really intended as a parser (one way) from json to CL, not really serializing to json.
- (2) Ignoring the reversed order issue, consider the following from jonathan. We decode a json object as an alist. Jonathan returns an alist with dotted pairs. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
(jonathan:parse "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}" :as :alist)
(("b" . 2) ("a" . 1))
#+end_src
If we then pass that to jonathan:to-json, it throws an error because jonathan does not handle alists with dotted pairs. I am only calling this out because jonathan expressly provides you with the ability to return a json object as a dotted pair alist, but then cannot handle it going back the other direction.

Everyone passes when dealing with the easy array will no nulls involved.

*** Third test (Trickier Data Types)
Now we make it a bit trickier with the following json string, decoded and then encoded it to see if we got back the original. This has trickier bits because of the unicode, exponent and false and null. The results are pretty much what you would expect.

- (1) unicode expanded to the appropriate character which I will treat as a success
- (2) You need to pass :json-booleans-as-symbols t to the yason parse function as a keyword argument in order to get false and it will come out as a YASON:FALSE symbol
- (3) Exponent expanded to a decimal which I could argue is a success. Your call.
- (4) trivial-json-codec is really intended as a parser (one way) from json to CL, not really serializing to json.
- (5) both false and null are converted to [], but they are different concepts.

** CL -> Json -> CL

We did this testing with a simple alist with undotted pairs. Since this is an alist, cl-json and json use specialized functions :encode-json-alist-to-string to successfully write json, then read back a result that is symmetrical to the original alist.

* Security
<<security>>
Getting json objects from another source is just as insecure as any other data you receive from another source. You are still responsible for ensuring that you have properly sanitized, validated or other checked the security of the data.

Redditor lokedhs has pointed out that "I'd be careful about using any JSON library that uses keywords for hash keys (like CL-JSON). The reason is that if you are using it to parse unchecked input, it can be used to cause a denial of service attack by sending maps that contain random keys. Every key will be interned into the keyword package, which are never garbage collected, causing an out of memory condition after a while." Cl-json flags the issue and provides the function safe-json-intern - which will throw an error if the keyword to be interned does not already exist in the \star{}json-symbols-package*. - so at least you are warned and provided with an alternative. The following code will throw an error if alpha-omega is not already interned in the \star{}json-symbols-package*.
#+begin_src lisp
  (setf cl-json::*identifier-name-to-key* #'cl-json::safe-json-intern)
  (cl-json:decode-json-from-string "{\"alpha-omega\": 1}")
#+end_src

Boost-json and Jonathan also does seem to have this as a potential issue. Boost-json decodes json objects to a CLOS object with slot-value names interned in the boost-json package.

com.gigamonkeys.json, com.inuoe.jzon, json, json-lib, json-streams, jsown, shasht and st-json do not intern the keywords. Yason doesn't intern the keywords in the library but the test files do, giving you the impression that it assumes that will be normal practice.

You will see in the next section when it talks about malformed data that certain strings can also hang the system or exhaust the stack (typically by opening thousands of json arrays or objects and never closing them). Com.inuoe.jzon, json-lib and json-streams have maximum level limits that can be used to prevent this type of overloading from happening.

* Standard Conformity and Dealing with Malformed Data
<<standard-conformity>>
<<json-test-suite>>
To check standard conformity and test for malformed data, we will take advantage of some of the test suites that have come out for json. Some can be found at, specifically [[https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite][https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite]]. You may also find interesting reading at [[https://yitzchak.github.io/shasht/parsing.html#17][https://yitzchak.github.io/shasht/parsing.html#17]]
and [[http://www.seriot.ch/parsing_json.php][http://www.seriot.ch/parsing_json.php]].

One thing to take into consideration, bearing in mind your own fact pattern is whether you agree or disagree with Jon Postel's robustness principle:
#+begin_quote
      "Be strict when sending and tolerant when receiving. Implementations must follow specifications precisely when sending to the network, and tolerate faulty input from the network.  When in doubt, discard faulty input silently, without returning an error message unless this is required by the specification."
#+end_quote
If you follow this logic, your encoding function should be perfectly compliant and your decoding function may want to accept invalid json (subject to security concerns). According to [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomson-postel-was-wrong-03][https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomson-postel-was-wrong-03]],the robustness principle should be read in the context of dealing with imperfect protocols, not everything under the sun including implementation bugs.

** Conformity Testing
While json has a standard, it is arguably under-specified. Using the tests from [[https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite][https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite]], I intended to focus on whether the libraries correctly parsed json strings that must be accepted and whether they throw errors on json strings that must be rejected. However, as you will see, how the libraries handle the "must reject" strings and "under-specified" strings also implicate security and stability. Some libraries' attempts to handle intentionally malformed json strings actually hung sbcl or triggered stack exhaustion. These are not the libraries you want facing uncontrolled input.
<<must-accept>>
*** Must Accept
This batch of json strings whould be accepted by all libraries. The only libraries to meet that standard are com.inuoe.jzon and com.gigamonkeys.json. Almost all the rest came "reasonably" close. Json-streams has the dubious distinction of not accepting any.

*** Can Accept or Reject
This batch of json strings were designed to find the under-specified holes in the json specification. As such, libraries could accept or reject the strings without being out of compliance with the standard. For purposes of the following table, I only tested files that could be read as encoded in utf-8.

What I found troubling was that jonathan, jsown and shasht all hung on one or more of these strings.

* Benchmarking

<<read-times>>
** Read Times
Jsown maintains its crown as the fastest parser (assuming no errors in the file). It is beaten slightly by jonathan on tiny strings, but jonathan shows a slow-down with certain nested json objects that gets progressively worse as string sizes increase. If we take a quick look at benchmarking with *tiny* json strings, we get read time chart comparisons that look like the following. The numbers come from applying the cost-of-nothing benchmark function against the libraries parsing the json string immediately below and using cl-spark's vspark function.

yason-alist and yason-plist are shorthand for (yason:parse data :object-as :alist) and (yason:parse data :object-as :plist)

The read times start to look different with respect to nested json objects as the file sizes increase. The next chart is a 2.7k json nested object. Jonathan is slightly behind json, but still looking good compared to the rest of the libraries. The json dataset for this and the next chart are subsets of a Nobel prize dataset which can be found at [[http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json][http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json]]. We are dropping trivial-json-codec out at this point because it claims the data is invalid.

Switching to trivial-benchmarking numbers and just taking the cumulative timing and consing for 20 runs of these three json strings and just comparing jonathan v. com.inuoe.jzon. Obviously the first thing that jumps out is the garbage collection while jonathan parses the 221k json string. Look at the relative increase. The largest string is 8162% larger than the smallest, but jonathan's run time increases by 100000% and the bytes consed increases by 576000%. At the same time com.inuoe.jzon's increases slightly less than the increase in string size.

Now looking at parsing a 1.2 MB json string with nested objects, jonathan is orders of magnitude slower than all the other libraries. The dataset can be found at [[https://github.com/mledoze/countries/blob/master/countries.json][https://github.com/mledoze/countries/blob/master/countries.json]].

Interestingly, if we go up to a 9.8 MB file (still on the small side) downloaded from [[https://www.vizgr.org/historical-events/search.php?format=json&begin_date=-3000000&end_date=20151231&lang=en][https://www.vizgr.org/historical-events/search.php?format=json&begin_date=-3000000&end_date=20151231&lang=en]], we see substantial improvement from jzon (com.inoue.jzon) and some slowing down from gigamonkeys and huge slow downs fom yason when decoding to plist and alist. I am going to guess that there is something different in the structure of the files which jzon handles faster than the 1.2 MB file. Again, trivial-json-codec rejected the data as invalid, so it is left out.

Boost-json is one of the faster decoders. The author notes that he personally uses it to parse extremely large, genomics JSON-list files (several GB in size). The author and I have different opinions on nil/false/null/[] and whether they actually have meaningful differences. He does not think so; I disagree. It does have issues on the encoding side, sometimes losing values when encoding vectors and is generally one of the slowest writers. I think it has value in the right use cases, but you do need to make sure it meets your particular needs.

<<boost-json-decoding>>
*** Decoding
Boost-json has different functions for decoding from strings (json-decode) or streams (json-read). Json arrays are decoded to CL lists and json objects are decoded to a CLOS object with slot-value names interned in the boost-json package.

I find its handling of nil and false a bit confusing. Consider the following examples:
#+begin_src lisp
(boost-json:json-decode "[false]")
(NIL)

(boost-json:json-decode "{\"A\":false}")
#<BOOST-JSON:JSON-OBJECT {"A":null}>
#+end_src
Within an array, json's 'false' is converted to CL nil, but within a json object, json's 'false' is convert to CL :null. Why?

We also have a symmetry problem with respect to json's 'false'. See the following:
#+begin_src lisp
  (boost-json:json-encode
   (boost-json:json-decode "{\"A\":false}"))
  {"A":null}
#+end_src
The starting point with 'false' got converted to null.

Boost-json does not handle unicode surrogate pairs if you care about that sort of thing.
<<boost-json-decoding-to-clos>><<boost-json-decoding-nested-objects-to-clos>>
**** Decoding to CLOS object
Now let's talk about boost-json's automagic decoding json objects to a json-object which is a standard CLOS object. Let's start with a simple version before we go to nested objects.
#+begin_src lisp
(boost-json:json-decode "{ \"weights\" : [ 0.5, 0.5 ] }")
#<BOOST-JSON:JSON-OBJECT {"weights":#}>

(describe (boost-json:json-decode "{ \"weights\" : [ 0.5, 0.5 ] }"))
#<BOOST-JSON:JSON-OBJECT {"weights":#}>
  [standard-object]

Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  MEMBERS                        = (("weights" (0.5 0.5)))
#+end_src
It appears that you need to call (boost-json:json-getf obj keyword) in order to act as an accessor to the automagically built CLOS object:
#+begin_src lisp
  (boost-json:json-getf
   (boost-json:json-decode "{ \"weights\" : [ 0.5, 0.5 ] }")
   "weights")
  (0.5 0.5)
#+end_src
or, of course, you can use slot-value, just remember that the slot-value name will be interned in the boost-json package..

Now let's look at a nested object. As a reminder, we will use the following parameter:
#+begin_src lisp
(defparameter *nested-address-1* "{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",
  \"address\": {
    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}")
#+end_src
If we want to get the city from the CLOS object that boost-json created, it might look something like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (boost-json:json-getf
   (boost-json:json-getf
    (boost-json:json-decode *nested-address-1*)
    "address")
   "city")
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src

<<boost-json-encoding>>
*** Encoding
On the plus side, boost-json was one of two libraries which could encode a pathname.

On the neutral side, data types like char and structs would require you to write an encoding method to handle them if you have them.

On the "choose your data structures carefully side",
- Encoding hash-tables succeeds if the hash-table keys are strings, fails if they are symbols
- Encoding vectors results in invalid results, generally losing the first value in the array. Sample output on a simple nested array looked like: [,"Cork","Limerick"][,[,"Frankfurt","Munich"]]
- Boost-json will try to encode alists as json arrays of array. It will generate invalid json if the alisp has dotted pairs.
    #+begin_src lisp
      (boost-json:json-encode '(("A" . 1) ("B" . 2) ("C" . 3)))
      [["A",. 1],["B",. 2],["C",. 3]]
    #+end_src
    If the array is not dotted pairs, boost-json will give you arrays of arrays.
    #+begin_src lisp
      (boost-json:json-encode '(("A"  1) ("B"  2) ("C"  3)))
      [["A",1],["B",2],["C",3]]
    #+end_src

<<boost-json-encoding-clos>>
**** Encoding CLOS class instances
For boost-json to encode a CLOS class instance, you need to provide a new json-write method for that class unless it is a json-object class. In the decoding examples, we saw a json object "{\"weights\" : [ 0.5, 0.5 ] }" get decoded to a boost-json:json-object:
  #+begin_src lisp
    (boost-json:json-encode
     (boost-json:json-decode "{ \"weights\" : [ 0.5, 0.5 ] }"))
    {"weights":[0.5,0.5]}
  #+end_src
If we tried that with our simple person class which is not a boost-json:json-object,
#+begin_src lisp
(boost-json:json-encode (make-instance 'person))
; Evaluation aborted on #<SB-PCL::NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD-ERROR {1005573E93}>.
#+end_src
You could use the existing methods in [[https://github.com/cl-boost/json/blob/main/encode.lisp][https://github.com/cl-boost/json/blob/main/encode.lisp]] or, for our very simple person class, something like the following could work:
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod boost-json:json-write ((person person) &optional stream)
  (let ((accessors '(("name" name) ("eye_colour" eye-colour))))
    (write-char  #\{ stream)
    (loop :for (key val) :in accessors
          :for first := t :then nil
          :unless first :do (write-char #\, stream)
          do
          (boost-json::json-write key stream)
          (write-char #\: stream)
          (boost-json::json-write (funcall val person) stream))
    (write-char  #\} stream)))
#+end_src
*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json it only fails on dealing with 'false'.

It had more problems going from CL->Json->CL. In some tests it triggered an error with an expected #\N, in others nil came back as nul and it could lose the first value in vectors.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data.

Boost-json did not exhibit the first issue in the same way that e.g. cl-json does. However, it does decode json objects to a CLOS object with slot-value names interned in the boost-json package.

With respect to the second issue, boost-json properly rejected 145 malformed test cases but accepted 28. Some of those malformed test cases which were accepted actually triggered stack exhaustion by opening too many levels of json open arrays and not closing them or similar types of issues.

*** Conformity with Json Standard
Boost-json accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept".  The failures were on:  [123e65], [123e45] and [123.456e78]

It accepted 13 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.

cl-json is an old workhorse in area, however, it has not been updated in the last seven years and is fairly slow as you can tell from the [[benchmarking][benchmarks]]. It does not handle unicode surrogate pairs, json's null and is not as likely to be symmetric as some of the other libraries. Like most of the other libraries (except jsown), cl-json does not encode multi-dimensional arrays. As noted in the [[security][security]] section, cl-json interns keys into the keyword package which can open you up to the equivalent of a DOS attack. cl-json does provide a mitigation function which will throw an error if the keyword to be interned does not already exist in the \star{}json-symbols-package*.

#+begin_src lisp
  (setf cl-json::*identifier-name-to-key* #'cl-json::safe-json-intern)
  (cl-json:decode-json-from-string "{\"alpha-omega\": 1}")
#+end_src

On the plus side, cl-json does probably have the best support for converting json data to clos objects and vice versa, but surprisingly does not handle structs. Unlike many of the other libraries, it does handle symbols without you having to write a new method. It allows you to handle incremental encoding.

With respect to conformity testing, cl-json was 92/95 for the json strings it must accept, so middle of the pack. It did not do so well rejecting malformed strings and, like most of the other libraries could exhaust the stack when facing certain types of [[malformed-data][malformed strings]].

When you are looking at plists and alists, cl-json provides specific functions for dealing with those structures rather than attempting to guess how they should be translated into json.

| standard object         | ->  | object                           |
- (1) This is cl-json's default mode. Using cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics or cl-json:simple-clos-semantics will switch cl-json into a mode where json arrays are decoded to cl vectors rather than lists, and json objects are decoded to CLOS objects rather than alists.
*** Decoding
<<cl-json-decoding>>

Cl-json uses different functions to decode from a string (decode-json-from-string x) v. decoding from a stream (decode-json x).

It converts json's 'null' to NIL, which I disagree with. It also fails to deal with unicode surrogate pairs if you care about those.

Json objects are converted to alists with dotted pairs which is unusual for the rest of the libraries.

<<cl-json-data-to-clos>> <<cl-json-fluid-class-objects>>
**** Json data to CLOS Object
While cl-json normally returns json objects as arrays, you could tell it to return the json object as an cl-json:fluid-class CLOS object. You do need to at least temporarily set the change the decoder to use simple-clos-semantics and set the \star{}json-symbols-package* to nil. (It should be noted that since the decoder maintains a class registry, this is thread unsafe. According to the docs, if every incoming JSON Object is guaranteed to have a prototype with a "lispClass" member then there are no fluid objects and thread safety is ensured. If the user wishes to employ fluid objects in a threaded environment it is advisable to wrap the body of entry-point functions in with-local-class-registry.

#+begin_src lisp
(cl-json:set-decoder-simple-clos-semantics)
#+end_src

You can reset the decoder back to lists with the function:

#+begin_src lisp
(set-decoder-simple-list-semantics)
#+end_src
This example temporarily changes the cl-json decoder semantics so that it creates a cl-json:fluid class, then we can get the birthday slot value of that class.

For example purposes, consider two json objects, \star{}address-1* and \star{}nested-address-1*:
#+begin_src javascript
  *address-1*
  "{
    \"name\": \"George Washington\",
    \"birthday\": \"February 22, 1732\",
    \"address\": \"Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States\"
  }"

*nested-address-1*
"{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",
  \"address\": {
    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}"
#+end_src
First, looking at the simpler version, notice you need to specify the slots in the fluid-class object:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *address-1*)))
      (with-slots (name birthday address) x
        birthday)))
  "1732-02-22"
#+end_src
Just to check something, lets describe that instance of the fluid-class:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
   (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
   (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *address-1*)))
     (describe x)))

  <#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100319AEA3}> {1003358763}>
  [standard-object]

  Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  NAME                           = "George Washington"
  BIRTHDAY                       = "February 22, 1732"
  ADDRESS                        = "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"
#+end_src
 Now looking at the nested version, we need to note that by default cl-json will convert the underscores in the json keys to double hyphens in the slot names.
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (with-slots (first--name last--name birthday address) x
        (values x first--name last--name birthday address))))
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {10107CF9E3}>
  "George"
  "Washington"
  "1732-02-22"
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {10107CF6F3}>
#+end_src
Because we have a nested class, we would need drill down and specify the slots for the sub-object as well:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (with-slots (first--name last--name birthday address) x
        (with-slots (street--address city state country) address
          (values x first--name last--name birthday address city)))))
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {1010E69B93}>
  "George"
  "Washington"
  "1732-02-22"
  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100F765713}> {1010E698A3}>
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src
We can also use slot values to get the info, but before we do that, let's use the nested-address sample data and just describe the object instance.
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (describe x)))

  #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100319AEA3}> {10039F9CC3}>
  [standard-object]

  Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  NAME                           = #<unbound slot>
  BIRTHDAY                       = "1732-02-22"
  ADDRESS                        = #<#<JSON:FLUID-CLASS COMMON-LISP:NIL {100319AEA3}> {100388FC13}>
  STREET--ADDRESS                = #<unbound slot>
  CITY                           = #<unbound slot>
  STATE                          = #<unbound slot>
  COUNTRY                        = #<unbound slot>
  FIRST--NAME                    = "George"
  LAST--NAME                     = "Washington"
#+end_src
Ok, this surprised me. The fluid-class is showing all the slots it created from \star{}address-1* as well as the slots it created from \star{}nested-address-1*. We also see that the keys "first-name", "last-name" and "street-address" have double hyphens when they are slot names and the fluid class created slots for embedded address object.

So just to demonstrate using slot value to get the data from a fluid object:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (slot-value x 'first--name)))
  "George"
#+end_src
Now suppose we want to go into the nested address and get just the city. For that we need to descend down, creating another cl-json:fluid object and then access its city slot value:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (with-slots (first--name last--name birthday address) x
        (with-slots (street--address city state country) address
          city))))
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src
Or, using the slot-value approach:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
      (setf cl-json:*json-symbols-package* nil)
    (let ((x (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)))
      (slot-value (slot-value x 'address)
                  'city)))
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src
<<cl-json-encoding>>
*** Encoding
Basic encoding functionality is provided by the generic function encode-json. This can be customised with an entire series of macros as listed in the documentation. cl-json's basic encoding function returns an object when handed an alist and returns an array when handed a plist. When handed a list of plists or list of alists, encode-json will return an array but the list of plists returned an array of arrays and the list of alists returned an array of objects.

cl-json provides a function to encode the alist properly as key:value, but my samples do not show any difference between cl-json:encode-json and cl-json:encode-json-alist. It will encode a dotted alist as a json object with key:value pairs. It will encode a proper list alist as an array of arrays.
    #+begin_src lisp
      (cl-json:encode-json '(("A" . 1) ("B" . 2) ("C" . 3)))
      {"A":1,"B":2,"C":3}

      (cl-json:encode-json '(("A" 1) ("B" 2) ("C" 3)))
      [["A",1],["B",2],["C",3]]
    #+end_src

On the plus side,
- cl-json was the only library to handle encoding char out of the box.

On the "be care side:
- As you might expect, plists are treated the same as plain lists and will lose their key-value connections. If you want to keep the key-value connections, you can either convert the list to an alist or hash-table or use the cl-json:encode-json-plist function.

On the "slightly additional work" side:
- Encoding structures would require writing a specialized method
On the not-so-plus side:
- It encodes nil as null. You can use the helper library cl-json-helper to encode nil as "false".
- Attempting to encode a pathname triggers an error

<<cl-json-incremental>><<cl-json-incremental-encoding>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array.

#+begin_src lisp
		(cl-json:with-array ()
			(dotimes (i 3)
				(cl-json:encode-array-member i)))
		[0,1,2]
#+end_src
Now the second:
#+begin_src lisp
(cl-json:with-object ()
  (cl-json:encode-object-member "hello" "hu hu")
	(cl-json:as-object-member ("harr")
	(cl-json:with-array ()
	  (dotimes (i 3)
		  (cl-json:encode-array-member i)))))
{"hello":"hu hu","harr":[0,1,2]}
#+end_src
*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, it only fails on dealing with false.

Similarly, going from CL->Json->CL, you would need to deal with the fact that :NULL got converted to "null".
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data.

With respect to the first issue, Cl-json flags the issue and provides the function safe-json-intern - which will throw an error if the keyword to be interned does not already exist in the \star{}json-symbols-package*. - so at least you are warned and provided with an alternative.

With respect to the second issue, cl-json properly rejected 153 malformed test cases but accepted 20. Some of those malformed test cases which were accepted actually triggered stack exhaustion by opening too many levels of json open arrays and not closing them or similar types of issues.

*** Conformity with Json Standard
cl-json accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept".  It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45] and [123.456e78]

 It accepted 13 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.

*** Miscellaneous Information
<<cl-json-other-information>>

1.  Error Conditions
    Cl-json has several error conditions, some of them recoverable and some of them not recoverable. These include "unrecoverable-value-error", "json-syntax-error", "no-char-for-code", "cell-error" "type-error", errors for calling functions in the wrong environment and others. Please read the user-manual for more details.
2.  Cl-json has a converter from camel case to "lisp" (i.e., kebab case) and back again.
3.  Cl-json has a lot of other capabilities. The documentation is excellent and you should seriously consider the security considerations section of the user manual if you are going to be decoding uncontrolled JSON objects.

- *prototype* - A PROTOTYPE contains metadata for an object's class in a format easily serializable to JSON: either the name of the class as a string or (if it is anonymous) the names of the superclasses as a list of strings; and the name of the Lisp package into which the names of the class's slots and the name of the class / superclasses are to be interned.
- *rational-approximation*
- *safe-json-intern* - The default json-intern is not safe. Interns of many unique symbols could potentially use a lot of memory. An attack could exploit this by submitting something that is passed through cl-json that has many very large, unique symbols. This version is safe in that respect because it only allows symbols that already exists.
- *set-custom-vars*
- *set-decoder-simple-clos-semantics* - Set the decoder semantics to the following:
  - Strings and Numbers are decoded naturally, reals becoming floats.

  - Arrays are decoded to sequences of the type \star{}JSON-ARRAY-TYPE*.
  - Objects are decoded to CLOS objects.  Object keys are converted by the function \star{}JSON-IDENTIFIER-NAME-TO-LISP*.  If a JSON Object has a field whose key matches \star{}PROTOTYPE-NAME*, the class of the CLOS object and the package wherein to intern slot names are inferred from the corresponding value which must be a valid prototype.  Otherwise, a FLUID-OBJECT is constructed whose slot names are interned in \star{}JSON-SYMBOLS-PACKAGE*
- *set-decoder-simple-list-semantics* - Set the decoder semantics to the following:
  - Strings and Numbers are decoded naturally, reals becoming floats.
  - The literal name true is decoded to T, false and null to NIL.
  - Arrays are decoded to sequences of the type \star{}JSON-ARRAY-TYPE*.
  - Objects are decoded to alists.  Object keys are converted by the function \star{}JSON-IDENTIFIER-NAME-TO-LISP* and then interned in the package \star{}JSON-SYMBOLS-PACKAGE*.
- *simplified-camel-case-to-lisp* - Insert - between lowercase and uppercase chars. Ignore _ + * and several consecutive uppercase.
- *stream-array-member-encoder* - Return a function which takes an argument and encodes it to STREAM as a Member of an Array.  The encoding function is taken from the value of ENCODER (default is #'ENCODE-JSON).

<<gigamonkeys-decoding>>
*** Decoding
Com.gigamonkeys.json only takes strings as inputs. It does not handle unicode surrogate pairs. On the plus side, it handles NULL issues correctly.

As noted in the mapping table above, json objects will be decoded as plists (or nested plists). Consider the following example of decoding a nested json object:
#+begin_src lisp
(com.gigamonkeys.json:parse-json "{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",
  \"address\": {
    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}")

("first_name" "George" "last_name" "Washington" "birthday" "1732-02-22"
 "address"
 ("street_address" "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway" "city" "Mount Vernon"
  "state" "Virginia" "country" "United States"))
#+end_src

Arrays are decoded to vectors.

<<gigamonkeys-encoding>>
*** Encoding
There were a few surprises looking at what com.gigamonkeys.json would encode and not encode.
- It encodes keyword symbols, but not other symbols.
- It actually hangs on encoding chars and CLOS objects, which I found strange. Most of the other libraries generated errors.
- nil encodes to {} (yes, empty object)
- Attempting to encode a pathname triggers an error.
- Like some other libraries, it cannot deal with alists directly. Consider using alexandria:alist-hash-table to convert the alist to a hash table.
- On the other hand, in reversal from some of the other libraries, com.gigamonkeys.json will assume a plain list is a plist, returning a json object with key-value pairs. If the length of the list is odd, the final value in the list will be treated as a key and an empty set will be inserted as the value.

Let's take a closer look at the encoding functions. As noted previously, com.gigamonkeys.json will assume a plain list is a plist, returning a json object with key-value pairs. In the examples below, that means that since it is given a three value list, the third value is assumed to be the second key in an object and the value then is an empty set.
#+CAPTION: Encoding Functions applied to a list
#+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float multicolumn

|------------+----------+----------------------|
| json       | '(1 2 3) | "{\"1\":2,\"3\":{}}" |
| to-json    | '(1 2 3) | (1 2 3)              |
| write-json | '(1 2 3) | {"1":2,"3":{}}       |

#+CAPTION: Encoding Functions applied to an array
#+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float multicolumn
| Function   | Input    | Result    |
|------------+----------+-----------|
| json       | #(1 2 3) | "[1,2,3]" |
| to-json    | #(1 2 3) | #(1 2 3)  |
| write-json | #(1 2 3) | [1,2,3]   |

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, it did not have any issues.

As you might have expected given its ignoring lists, going from CL->Json->CL resulted in failure with tests starting with lists. If you started from an array, nil turned into {}, and it could get a little excited about how many decimal points it would return with respect to a float.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. com.gigamonkeys.json did not exhibit the first issue.

With respect to the second issue, com.gigamonkeys.json accepted many malformed test cases which triggered stack exhaustion by opening too many levels of json open arrays and not closing them or similar types of issues.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
com.gigamonkeys.json accepted all 95 test cases that are considered "must accept".

It accepted 14 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.

- *\star{}object-type**
- *json* - The top-level function for converting Lisp objects into a string in the JSON format. It can convert any object that can be converted to a json-exp via the to-json generic function.
- *json-stringify* - Convert object directly to a json representation as a string. Default methods are provided for strings, symbols (which must be keywords), and numbers but there may be situations where it is appropriate to define new methods on this function. In general, however, it is probably better to define a method on to-json to convert the object to a sexp that can be rendered as json.
- *parse-json* - Parse json text into Lisp objects. Hash tables are used to represent Javascript objects and vectors to represent arrays.
- *to-json* - Generic function that can convert an arbitrary Lisp object to a json-exp, i.e. a sexp that can then be rendered as json. To make an arbitrary class convertable to JSON, add a method to this generic function that generates a json-exp.
- *write-json* - Write data to stream in json format.

Com.inuoe.jzon looks at lists/alists/plists and tries to determine what is an alist or plist by looking at the key values.

<<jzon-decoding>>
*** Decoding

**** Acceptable Input for Parse
com.inuoe.jzon will accept, strings, octets in utf8, stream characters or binary in utf8, or a pathname (at which point the library will assume you want it to open a file for reading.

The README also notes that (parse ...) accepts the following keyword arguments:
- :allow-comments This allows the given JSON to contain //cpp-style comments
- :maximum-depth This controls the maximum depth to allow arrays/objects to nest. Can be a positive integer, or nil to disable depth tests. This turned out to be important when dealing with deliberately malformed incoming json data because the library was able to call a halt well before the stack was exhausted.
- :key-fn A function of one argument responsible for 'interning' object keys. Should accept a simple-string and return the 'interned' key. The :key-fn parameter could be #'alexandria:make-keyword if you wanted to make object keys into symbols (but this is a bad practice from a security standpoint if the incoming json data is uncontrolled.
<<jzon-encoding>>
*** Encoding
com.inuoe.jzon can encode to either a stream or string. E.g.:
     #+begin_src lisp
       (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '("A" "b" 4 3.2 9/4) :stream *standard-output*)
       ["A","b",4,3.2,2.25]

       (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '("A" "b" 4 3.2 9/4))
       "[\"A\",\"b\",4,3.2,2.25]"
     #+end_src

 Additional Keyword Parameters for Stringify
- :pretty If true, output pretty-formatted JSON
- :coerce-element A function for coercing 'non-native' values to JSON.
- :coerce-key A function for coercing key values to strings.


On the plus side,
- It automatically handles standard CLOS objects and also allows you to specialize.
- It is onne of only two libraries which can encode a structure

On the "pay attention to your data structures" side:
com.inuoe.jzon:stringify will encode an alist as a json object. It uses heuristics to predict what data structure it is using. Consider the difference between giving it an alist with dotted pairs and an alist without dotted pairs:
#+begin_src lisp
  (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '(("A" . 1) ("B" . 2) ("C" . 3)) :stream *standard-output*)
  {"A":1,"B":2,"C":3}

  (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '(("A" 1) ("B" 2) ("C" 3)) :stream *standard-output*)
  {"A":[1],"B":[2],"C":[3]}
#+end_src
Both are returned as json objects, but in the case of the undotted pairs, each value is embedded in its own array.
    It is pretty good at correctly guessing when something is a alist which should be encoded as key:value. Consider the following:
    #+begin_src lisp
      (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))))
                          :stream *standard-output*)
      {"foo":"bar","baz":[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]}
    #+end_src
and this particular sample works because it does not try to make an integer into a key. However, if you change the sample data slightly so that the first value in eash list in the embedded alist was a string, it would have predicated that the "A" and "B" should be keys. The next two examples show the differences between its interpretation depending on whether you provided dotted pairs or not:
#+begin_src lisp
  (com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . (("A" 2 3) ("B" 5 6))))
                            :stream *standard-output*)
  {"foo":"bar","baz":{"A":[2,3],"B":[5,6]}}

(com.inuoe.jzon:stringify '(("foo"  "bar") ("baz" (("A" 2 3) ("B" 5 6))))
                            :stream *standard-output*)
{"foo":["bar"],"baz":[{"A":[2,3],"B":[5,6]}]}
#+end_src
This may or may not have been what you wanted.

On the downside,
- Attempting to encode a pathname triggers an error.

**** Specialize Serialization
com.inuoe.jzon allows you to specialize the coerced-fields method to handle CL data types not included in the above list, including excluding, renaming and adding fields. See the [[https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/jzon][README]] for examples.
<<jzon-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
jzon incremental encoding is actively being worked on.
*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, it did not have any issues. It struggled a bit more with respect to going from CL->Json->CL. The first test had a starting point of:
#+begin_src lisp
   ((:NAME "George Washington") (:BIRTHDAY "February 22, 1732")
                                (:ADDRESS "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"))
#+end_src
and a result (adjusted to get the elements out of the hash-table) of:
#+begin_src lisp
   (("address" . #("Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"))
    ("birthday" . #("February 22, 1732")) ("name" . #("George Washington")))
#+end_src
So we went from undotted alist to dotted alist where each value was an array instead of a string. The second test started with an array instead of an alist and com.inuoe.jzon handled it with the one caveat that :NULL turned into "NULL".
*** Security
 There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. com.inuoe.jzon did not exhibit the first issue.

 With respect to the second issue, com.inuoe.jzon rejected all the malformed test cases. It was one of four packages which allowed you to limit the depths to which it would dive in nested json objects and, therefore, did not trigger the stack exhaustion exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
com.inuoe.jzon accepted all 95 test cases that are considered "must accept".

It accepted 7 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking
  See [[benchmarking][Benchmarking]]

While jsown is the winner in the decoding speed stakes, Jonathan is a winner in [[write-times][encoding speed]] along with [[st-json][st-json]]. However, speed is not everything and there are a few concerning issues.

- As previously noted, jonathan shows substantial slow downs in decoding nested json objects of any real size.
- Jonathan is unable to parse float if SAFETY restricted to 2 or 3 on SBCL. See [[https://github.com/Rudolph-Miller/jonathan/issues/66][https://github.com/Rudolph-Miller/jonathan/issues/66]].

- (1) Jonathan can parse a json object into plists (the default), alists, hash-tables or a "json object" by passing different keyword parameters to the parse function.
<<jonathan-decoding>>
*** Decoding
**** Overview
Jonathan decodes strings, not streams.   In testing, jonathan hung when trying to decode "[123e-10000000]". In its default settings, jonathan will decode a json null as nil, but if you set jonathan:*null-value* to :null, it will decod a json null properly as :null.

Jonathan parse a json object by default into plists, usually reversed. You can change the resulting data structure by passing :as :XXX to the parse function. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jonathan:parse "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}")
  (:|b| 2 :|a| 1)

  (jonathan:parse "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}" :as :alist)
  (("b" . 2) ("a" . 1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp
(jonathan:parse *address-1* :as :jsown)
(:OBJ ("address" . "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States")
 ("birthday" . "February 22, 1732") ("name" . "George Washington"))
#+end_src
The result is a cons cell format that appears to have originated with the jsown library.
<<jonathan-unicode>>
**** Unicode
Jonathan can parse unicode and escaped unicode characters and can return unicode characters or escaped unicode characters.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jonathan:parse "\"\\u30b8\\u30e7\\u30ca\\u30b5\\u30f3\"")
  "ジョナサン"

  (jonathan:parse "\"\\u30b8\\u30e7\\u30ca\\u30b5\\u30f3\""
         :unescape-unicode-escape-sequence nil)
  "u30b8u30e7u30cau30b5u30f3"

  (jonathan:parse "{\"name\": \"ジョナサン\"}")
  (:|name| "ジョナサン")
#+end_src
<<jonathan-filters>>
**** Nested Json Objects (Filters and Subsets)
Jonathan can easily extract a subset of data from the first level of a nested object, but you need to write a recursion method if you need to extract a subset of nested data that is deeper in the json object.

#+begin_src lisp
  (jonathan:parse *nested-address-1* :keywords-to-read '("first_name"))
  (:|first_name| "George")

  (jonathan:parse *nested-address-1* :keywords-to-read '("address"))
  (:|address|
    (:|country| "United States" :|state| "Virginia" :|city| "Mount Vernon"
                                :|street_address| "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway"))

  (jonathan:parse *nested-address-1* :keywords-to-read '("state"))
  nil
#+end_src

**** Allow json comment string
- can allow junked JSON format string (:junk-allowed t)
- can customize *null-value*, *false-value* and *empty-array-value*.
- can restrict keywords to read. (:keywords-to-read)
- can normalize keywords. (:keyword-normalizer)
- can not normalize keywords in nested objects.
- can ignore keywords when normalizer returns NIL.
- can unescape unicode escape sequences. (:unescape-unicode-escape-sequence)
<<jonathan-encoding>>
*** Encoding
The basic encoding function is jonathan:to-json. Jonathan can return either a string or octets.
#+begin_src lisp
(jonathan:to-json '(:name "Common Lisp" :born 1984 :impls (SBCL KCL))
         :octets t)
#(123 34 78 65 77 69 34 58 34 67 111 109 109 111 110 32 76 105 115 112 34 44 34
  66 79 82 78 34 58 49 57 56 52 44 34 73 77 80 76 83 34 58 91 34 83 66 67 76 34
  44 34 75 67 76 34 93 125)
#+end_src

When encoding alists or plists or jsown "objects", jonathan requires extra keyword parameters like :from :alist (or :plist, :jsown)
#+begin_src lisp
  (jonathan:to-json '((a 1) (b 2)) :from :alist)
  "{\"A\":[1],\"B\":[2]}"
#+end_src

While to-json can handle a plist without any additional parameters, to-json will throw an error if handed an alist without warning. This gets resolved by adding the additional keyword parameters :from :alist
#+begin_src lisp
(jonathan:to-json '((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3)) :from :alist)
"{\"A\":1,\"B\":2,\"C\":3}"
#+end_src
Jonathan expects simple-strings, so if your data source does not produce simple strings, you may have to massage the input to get there. Similarly, attempting to encode a char or a pathname will trigger an error. I think you can write methods that would handle them. The same situation arises with respect to encoding structs.

Now consider what happens when jonathan tries to encode alists with dotted pairs:
    #+begin_src lisp
      (jonathan:to-json '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))) :from :alist)

      "{\"foo\":\"bar\",\"baz\":{\"1\":[2,3],\"4\":[5,6]}}"
    #+end_src
    and now without dotted pairs.
    #+begin_src lisp
      (jonathan:to-json '(("foo" "bar") ("baz"  ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))) :from :alist)
      "{\"foo\":[\"bar\"],\"baz\":[{\"1\":[2,3],\"4\":[5,6]}]}"
    #+end_src
In both situations, jonathan is trying to force key:value pairs into places you would not expect.

<<jonathan-encoding-clos>>
Jonathan can encode CLOS objects to json if you create a method for that class. Consider our person class:
#+begin_src lisp
(defclass person ()
    ((name
      :initarg :name :initform "Sabra"
      :accessor name)
     (eye-colour :initarg :eye-colour
      :initform "brown"
      :accessor eye-colour)))
#+end_src
Creating the required method for this class is straight forward:
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod jonathan:%to-json ((person person))
              (jonathan:with-object
                  (jonathan:write-key-value "name" (slot-value person 'name))
                  (jonathan:write-key-value "eye-colour" (slot-value person 'eye-colour))))
#+end_src
That then allows you to write something like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((data (make-instance 'person)))
    (jonathan:to-json data))
  "{\"name\":\"Sabra\",\"eye-colour\":\"brown\"}"
#+end_src
<<jonathan-incremental>><<jonathan-incremental-encoding>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array.
#+begin_src lisp
	(jonathan:with-output (*standard-output*)
			(jonathan:with-array ()
				(dotimes (i 3)
					(jonathan:write-item i))))
[0,1,2]
#+end_src
The second is also straight forward.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jonathan:with-output (*standard-output*)
    (jonathan:with-object
        (jonathan:write-key-value "hello" "hu hu")
      (jonathan:write-key "harr")
      (jonathan:write-value
       (jonathan:with-array ()
         (dotimes (i 3)
           (jonathan:write-item i))))))
  {"hello":"hu hu","harr":[0,1,2]}
#+end_src

*** Symmetry
      From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, jonathan reversed the order of the list and converted both falsee and null to [].
      Going from CL->Json->CL, it is not symmetric if the alists have dotted pairs. The array test resulted in getting the array converted into a list and :NULL was converted to nil.
*** Security
  There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. Jonathan has the first issue.

  With respect to the second issue, jonathan properly rejected 128 out of 173 malformed test cases. Unfortunately it was one of the packages that accepted malformed json data that would trigger stack exhaustion.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
  jonathan accepted 94 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It signaled an overflow when trying to decode "[123.456e78]".

  It accepted 9 out of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject. It actually hung when trying to decode the underflow number [123e-10000000].

<<json-lib-decoding>>

*** Decoding
Json-lib parses utf-8 encoding json strings (and not streams). So if you are reading a json encoded file, you would need to specify in the input stream conversions that utf-8 be used. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
(json-lib:parse (alexandria:read-file-into-string "file.json"
                                                  :external-format :utf8))
#+end_src
As with many of the libraries, it decodes a json 'null' as NIL. It also fails to handle unicode surrogate pairs if you care about that.

According to the README, the json-lib parser uses whitespace presence, regardless of commas, as a delimiting marker.
<<json-lib-nested-json-objects>>
**** Nested JSON Objects
Json-lib does require that you completely parse the json data instead of being able to filter it while taking it in. Taking the nested JSON object below, how could we get a information out of the innermost nested object?

#+begin_src json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "integer": 29,
      "float": 16.8278,
      "fullname": "Milton Jensen",
      "bool": false
    }
  ]
}
#+end_src
You need to know your data structure so that you can figure out how to walk the tree. How would we get the value of the key "integer"? Looking at it, it is a JSON object which keyword "items"contains an array which contains a JSON object.

By default, json-lib decodes json objects to hash-tables and arrays into vectors. So we can descend the parsed json tree in this particular example something like this (assuming the json object was in a file named json4.txt):
#+begin_src lisp
  (gethash "integer"
           (aref
            (gethash "items"
                     (json-lib:parse
                      (alexandria:read-file-into-string #P"/home/sabra/json4.txt")))
            0))

  29
#+end_src
<<json-lib-encoding>>
*** Encoding
Json-lib will encode to strings, not streams. Some idiosyncrasies are noted in the following points:
 -  It encodes keyword symbols, but other symbols get encoded to "null"
  - It encodes a char to "null". You could write a method to handle char
  - Ratios are encoded as "null"
  - Attempting to encode a pathname triggers an error
  - In encoding a hash-table, json-lib will be successful if the hash-table keys are strings or keyword symbols. If the keys are other symbols, the key will be rendered as "null".
*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, json-lib lost the unicode character in the middle of a string and converted false to null.

Going from CL->Json->CL, it took an input of alists and converted it to vectors of vectors with keywords symbols being turned into strings. In the second test it took an array input and the only hiccup was converting :NULL to "null".
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data.
json-lib did not exhibit the first issue.

With respect to the second issue, json-lib rejected 110 out of 173 malformed test cases. It was one of four packages which allowed you to limit the depths to which it would dive in nested json objects and, therefore, did not trigger the stack exhaustion exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
json-lib accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45] and [123.456e78]

It accepted 12 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking
  See [[benchmarking][Benchmarking]]

*** Miscellaneous Comments
Json-lib has conversion functions lisp-to-snakecase, snakecase-to-lisp and lisp-to-camelcase. These will only be applied to keyword symbols.

*** Json-lib exported symbols
- *encode-string*
- *parse* - Given an encoded utf-8 json string, returns a cl structure or value. If use-keywords-for-keys is T, then hash table keys will be constructed as keywords. If an object-key-handler lambda/function is provided, this will be called for each object key and the result value used for the specific object key. By default the limit is 1000 for structural depth, but this can be set with the keyword max-depth. Exponent representation in serialized form is limited to a length of 2 to prevent huge values causing slow downs and other issues in the conversion process.
- *stringify* - Converts the given data structure to a stringified json form, suitable for serialization and other uses. An optional function can be passed for case encoding of native lisp keyword structures. If a function for unencodable-items is provided, this function will be called, and should return a JSON compliant string representing the encoded items. If no value is provided for unencodable-items, the json null value is used.

 | [[json-streams][json-streams]] | Thomas Bakketun, Stian Sletner | GPL3    | [[http://github.com/rotatef/json-streams][http://github.com/rotatef/json-streams]] |

The author describes Json-streams advantages as:

- Separation of low-level and high-level functionality. json-streams provides a basic tokenizer for json, so that it's easy to build any data structure mapping one wants on top of it. All the other json libraries could in theory be built on it. The problem with many of them is that they've chosen a particular data mapping that very often is non-deterministic (False and [] both map to NIL, for example), or simply doesn't suit a particular use case. With json-streams you have full control of these things. But it also comes with a high-level API with a chosen mapping so it's ready to use.
- The API is streaming, so you don't have to process more than you want to, and you can process files of any size.
- Both Unicode and numbers are properly handled.

I am a bit surprised that something like json-streams that advertises itself as designed to be used as a building block for more high level libraries has no doc strings. Fortunately the README appears to be fairly comprehensive. However, after trying it during the course of testing, I am not convinced that it offers flexibility enough to counter the out of the box functionality of many of the other libraries, nor does it offer any speed advantage.
<<json-streams-mapping>>
*** Default Mapping
This is the default mapping. Do you see a distinct lack of data structures on the CL side? See the discussion under [[json-streams-encoding][Json-streams Encoding]] for more info.
| JSON   | Common Lisp                      |
|--------+----------------------------------|
| true   | T                                |
| false  | NIL                              |
| null   | :NULL                            |
| string | string                           |
| number | integer, float or ratio          |
| array  | (:ARRAY ... )  (1)               |
| object | (:OBJECT (key . value) ... ) (1) |
(1) This is a cons and not a CLOS object.

<<json-streams-decoding>>

*** Decoding
Generally speaking json-streams does what you would expect with respect to decoding. As you might expect, given the name, it can handle either stream or string input. However, consider parsing the two following json strings. The first is a json object which includes a json array and the second is just an array::
#+begin_src lisp
  (json-streams:json-parse "{\"A\":false,\"B\":[false]}")
  (:OBJECT ("A") ("B" :ARRAY NIL))

  (json-streams:json-parse "[\"B\",false]")
  (:ARRAY "B" NIL)
#+end_src
Both of the results are CONS. I do not know what I was expecting, but it probably was not that.

<<json-streams-encoding>>

*** Encoding
I found json-streams frustrating when it comes to simple, straightforward encoding. You cannot just pass CL data to it and assume that it will work.

- (1) A fell through ETYPECASE expression. Wanted one of ((OR STRING REAL) (MEMBER T NIL) (MEMBER :NULL) JSON-STREAMS:JSON-ARRAY JSON-STREAMS:JSON-OBJECT).

So how do you actually use stringify? Well,
| Data                                                             | Result                      | Comment |
|------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------|

| (json-stringify '(:object ("a". 1) ("b" . 2) ("c". 3)))          | "{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3}" |         |
| (json-stringify '(:object ("a" 1) ("b" 2) ("c" 3)))              | Error (1)                   | Oops    |
- (1) A fell through ETYPECASE expression. Wanted one of ((OR STRING REAL) (MEMBER T NIL) (MEMBER :NULL) JSON-STREAMS:JSON-ARRAY JSON-STREAMS:JSON-OBJECT).

In case you were wondering, json-stringify json-stringify-multiple and json-stringify-single are regular functions. You cannot just write a new method to deal with a new datatype. They take a type json-object, json-array or json-string defined as:
#+begin_src lisp
(deftype json-object ()
  '(cons (member :object) t))
#+end_src
<<json-streams-encoding-arrays>> <<json-streams-encoding-hash-tables>>
As result, when you want to encode CL data structures, you need to resort to more complicated calls such as the following for dealing with hash tables or similar calls. :
#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((data (alexandria:plist-hash-table '("foo" 1 "bar" (7 8 9)) :test #'equal)))
    (json-streams:with-json-output (nil :key-encoder #'string-downcase :indent t)
      (json-streams:with-json-object
          (json-streams:json-output-member :my-hash-table data))))

  "{\"my-hash-table\": {\"foo\": 1,\"bar\": [7,8,9]}}"
#+end_src
This does not always work and there is no obvious way to just write additional methods dealing with new lisp data types other than to write your own methods which then wrap around lower level json-streams components. This essentially means that dealing with any type of CL data structure requires that you engage in incremental encoding.

<<json-streams-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array.
#+begin_src lisp
  (json-streams:with-json-output (nil :key-encoder #'string-downcase :indent t)
    (json-streams:with-json-array
        (dotimes (i 3) (json-streams:json-output-value i))))
  "[0,1,2]"
#+end_src
And now the second:
#+begin_src lisp
  (json-streams:with-json-output (nil :key-encoder #'string-downcase)
    (json-streams:with-json-object
        (json-streams:json-output-member "hello" "hu hu")
      (json-streams:with-json-member :harr
        (json-streams:with-json-array
            (dotimes (i 3) (json-streams:json-output-value i))))))
  "{\"hello\":\"hu hu\",\"harr\":[0,1,2]}"
#+end_src
The following is a more complicated version from the README:
#+begin_src lisp
(with-json-output (nil :key-encoder #'string-downcase :indent t)
                 (with-json-object
                     (json-output-member :first-name "John")
                   (json-output-member :last-name "Smith")
                   (with-json-member :is-alive (json-output-boolean t))
                   (json-output-member :age 25)
                   (with-json-member :address
                     (json-output-alist '((:street-address . "21 2nd Street")
                                          (:city . "New York")
                                          (:state . "NY")
                                          (:postal-code . "10021-3100"))))
                   (with-json-member :phone-numbers
                     (with-json-array
                         (json-output-plist '(:type "home"
                                              :number "212 555-1234"))
                       (json-output-plist '(:type "office"
                                            :number "646 555-4567"))
                       (json-output-plist '(:type "mobile"
                                            :number "123 456-7890"))))
                   (json-output-member :children #())
                   (with-json-member :spouse (json-output-null))))

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, json-streams had no issues.

Going from CL->Json->CL, it failed (as you might expect) with both the alist input and the vector input because you would need to write a new method for dealing with either one.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. json-streams did not exhibit the first issue.

With respect to the second issue, json-streams rejected all 173 malformed test cases. It was one of four packages which allowed you to limit the depths to which it would dive in nested json objects and, therefore, did not trigger the stack exhaustion exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard.
Without additional parameters, json-streams accepted 93 of 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". The rejected test cases were files with duplicate keys and those would have been accepted by passing the keyword parameter :duplicate-key-check nil.

It accepted 1 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.

*** Summary
Yes, it is the fastest in pure decoding but speed is not everything. You do have to be careful about what data structures you use. For example, encoding dotted alists triggered memory fault issues. It fails to deal with json's null properly and actually hung when trying to decode a json real number with an underflow problem.

On the plus side, it has the ability to extract a subset out of a json string, but you have to have read the entire string since it does not deal with streams.

*** Default Mappping
Please note the direction of the arrows in the following table.
| Lisp                    |     | Json                             |

<<jsown-decoding>>
*** Decoding
This is where jsown really shines. Jsown is by far the fastest decoder. It not only decodes, it also makes it easy to pull out elements of the json-object (at least at the first level of the object).

As a minor annoyance, parsing strings that have form feeds get translated to line feeds.

When reading json objects, jsown converts their content to the most lispy translation of what was in there. As such, json's false will be translated to nil, which coincidentally also be the translation of JSON's []. Json's null is also translated to nil.

As you can tell from the default mapping table, json arrays are decoded to lists and json objects decoded to cons cells:
#+begin_src lisp
(jsown:parse "[1, \"a\"]")
(1 "a")

(jsown:parse "{\"foo\": \"alpha\", \"bar\":3.2}")
(:OBJ ("foo" . "alpha") ("bar" . 16/5))
#+end_src

<<jsown-nested-json-objects>>
<<jsown-filters>>
**** Nested JSON Objects (Filters and Subsets)
Now consider the nested JSON object \star{}nested-address-1*. Again, as a reminder, here is the object.

#+begin_src json
"{
  \"first_name\": \"George\",
  \"last_name\": \"Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"1732-02-22\",
  \"address\": {
    \"street_address\": \"3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway\",
    \"city\": \"Mount Vernon\",
    \"state\": \"Virginia\",
    \"country\": \"United States\"
  }
}"
#+end_src
What can we do with it in jsown? It is a JSON object which keyword "address"contains another JSON object.

A basic call to parse returns a cons representing the entire object
#+begin_src lisp
(jsown:parse *nested-address-1*)
(:OBJ ("first_name" . "George") ("last_name" . "Washington")
 ("birthday" . "1732-02-22")
 ("address" :OBJ ("street_address" . "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway")
  ("city" . "Mount Vernon") ("state" . "Virginia")
  ("country" . "United States")))
#+end_src
If we add the keyword address, we get back a subset of the object:
#+begin_src lisp
(jsown:parse *nested-address-1* "address")
(:OBJ
 ("address" :OBJ ("street_address" . "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway")
  ("city" . "Mount Vernon") ("state" . "Virginia")
  ("country" . "United States")))
#+end_src
According to the README, "In order to achieve high performance when parsing specific keywords, the keywords to be found should be known at compile time. The compiler-macro-function can calculate the keyword container with the requested keywords at compile-time. When specifying the keywords in which you’re interested you should ignore any escaped characters. For instance, supplying the string “foo” will automatically match “f\\\\oo” too."

We can walk the tree deeper by applying the filter and val functions.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:val
   (jsown:filter
    (jsown:parse *nested-address-1*)
    "address")
   "city")
  "Mount Vernon"
#+end_src
Jsown has the ability, once a json object has been parsed into a jsown object, to get the first level keywords of the object.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:keywords (jsown:parse *nested-address-1*))
  ("first_name" "last_name" "birthday" "address")
#+end_src
Jsown also has the ability to loop over the first level keywords of an object:
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:do-json-keys (keyword value)
    (jsown:parse *nested-address-1*)
    (format t "~a => ~a~%" keyword value))

  first_name => George
  last_name => Washington
  birthday => 1732-02-22
  address => (OBJ (street_address . 3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway)
              (city . Mount Vernon) (state . Virginia) (country . United States))
#+end_src
On the downside, jsown actually hung when trying to decode an underflow number: "[123e-10000000]".

<<jsown-encoding>>
*** Encoding
(to-json x) is a generic function which you can specialize on your own types. This allows you to nest lisp objects in a jsown object and serialize them in a suitable way.

(to-json* x) is the non-generic function variant of the same thing. It isn't as smart, but it is faster.

Encoding chars, pathnames, CLOS objects, structs and other data structures not listed in the default mapping above will require that you write a new to-json method to handle that particular datatype.

On the plus side, jsown is the only library which can handle multi-dimensional arrays

When writing to json,lisp's nil is translated to the empty JSON list []. You can write json's false by writing lisp's keywords :false or :f.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:to-json (jsown:new-js ("items" nil) ("falseIsEmptyList" :f) ("success" t)))

  "{\"items\":[],\"falseIsEmptyList\":false,\"success\":true}"
#+end_src
As you can tell from the default mapping table, lists and vectors are automatically encoded to json arrays and hash-tables are encoded to json objects. As alists are considered lists of lists, an alist will return an array of arrays. Plists are treated the same as plain lists and will lose their key-value connections.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:to-json '(("a" "alpha") ("b" "beta")))
  "[[\"a\",\"alpha\"],[\"b\",\"beta\"]]"
#+end_src
You can specify that json returns an object.  The following call to to-json wraps the alist in another list headed by :obj and returns a json object.

#+begin_src lisp
 (jsown:to-json '(:obj (("a" "alpha") ("b" "beta"))))
  "{\"(a alpha)\":[[\"b\",\"beta\"]]}"
#+end_src
If jsown tries to encode an alist which has dotted cons cells, jsown triggered unhandled memory faults with sbcl 2.1.11-x86-64-linux, ccl version 1.12.1 LinuxX8664 and ecl-version 21.2.1. This appears to be because jsown has optimized the code and assumed that all lists will be proper lists. The assumption obviously fails in the context of dotted cons cells.

When to-json is called, jsown will internally call to-json each step of the way. This has a performance downside, yet it seems to provide the least surprises in the output. If you need more performance, jsown* offers that, at the cost of flexibility.

If you are constructing json objects, consider using the jsown:new-js and jsown:extend-js functions.jsown:js-new has a clean and clear interface for building content. It works together with jsown:extend-js if you need to split up the object creation.

Jsown has a setf-expander on (setf jsown:val) which automatically creates a jsown-object if no such object was available at the designated place. An example should clarify:

#+begin_src lisp
  (let (doc)
    (setf (jsown:val (jsown:val (jsown:val doc "properties") "color") "paint") "red")
    (jsown:to-json doc))

  "{\"properties\":{\"color\":{\"paint\":\"red\"}}}"
#+end_src

It turns out to be a handy little feature when you need to build deeply nested json documents.
<<jsown-encoding-clos>>
**** Encoding CLOS
Jsown does not have a handy ability to automagically encode clos classes. For that you would have to write your own jsown:to-json method. Taking our simple person class with slots name and eye-colour, such a method could look something like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod jsown:to-json ((object person))
    (jsown:to-json
     `(:obj ("name" . ,(name object))
            ("eye-colour" . ,(eye-colour object)))))

(jsown:to-json (make-instance 'person))
"{\"name\":\"Sabra\",\"eye-colour\":\"brown\"}"
#+end_src

<<jsown-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array. With jsown, I found using loop easier than dotimes.
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:to-json
   (loop :for i :from 0 :to 2 :collect i))
  "[0,1,2]"
#+end_src
The second exercise
#+begin_src lisp
  (jsown:to-json
   `(:obj
     ("hello" . "hu hu")
     ("harr" .
             ,(loop :for i :from 0 :to 2 :collect i))))
  "{\"hello\":\"hu hu\",\"harr\":[0,1,2]}"
#+end_src

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, jsown had no issues except for dealing with false and null.

Going from CL->Json->CL was more problematic. Keyword symbols became strings, :NULL became nil, a float was converted to a ratio and where the input started as an array, it returned a list.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. Jsown did not exhibit the first issue. With respect to the second issue, jsown rejected 102 out of 173 malformed test cases. Unfortunately some of those malformed json data strings did trigger the stack exhaustion exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
jsown accepted 93 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed on lonely numbers (an integer or negative real not within a json array or json object).

It accepted 9 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking
See [[benchmarking][Benchmarking]]

*** Miscellaneous
Issue 27 on github claims an unhandled memory fault on the following bad json string in sbcl 2.0.8, but I do not see that with ccl, clisp or sbcl 2.1.11, so this issue may have been fixed.
#+begin_src lisp

- *to-json** - Converts an object in internal jsown representation to a string containing the json representation
- *val* - Returns the value of the given key in object
- *val-safe* - Returns the value of <key> in <object> if <object> existed, or nil if it did not. A second value is returned which indicates whether or not the key was found.
- *with-injective-reader* - Rebinds \star{}parsed-*-value* so that reading json documents is injective and converting them back to json yields roughly the same document as the original. Rebinds: \star{}parsed-true-value* => :true,  \star{}parsed-false-value* => :false,  \star{}parsed-null-value* => :null

<<shasht-decoding>>
*** Decoding
To quote from the README:
The primary interface to parsing and reading JSON is the read-json function.
#+begin_src lisp
(read-json &optional input-stream-or-string (eof-error-p t) eof-value single-value-p)
#+end_src
The argument input-stream-or-string can be an stream, a string to read from, or nil to use \star{}standard-input*. The arguments eof-error-p and eof-value have the same affect as they do in the Common Lisp function read. If the single-value-p argument is true then the input to read-json is assumed to be a single value, which means that extra tokens at the end will cause an error to be generated.

There are a number of dynamic variables that will influence the parsing of JSON data.

- common-lisp:*read-default-float-format* — Controls the floating-point format that is to be used when reading a floating-point number.
- \star{}read-default-true-value* — The default value to return when reading a true token. Initially set to t.
- \star{}read-default-false-value* — The default value to return when reading a false token. Initially set to nil.
- \star{}read-default-null-value* — The default value to return when reading a null token. Initially set to :null.
- \star{}read-default-array-format* — The default format to use when reading an array. Current supported formats are :vector or :list. Initially set to :vector.
- \star{}read-default-object-format* — The default format to use when reading an object. Current supported formats are :hash-table, :alist or :plist. Initially set to :hash-table.

There is also a keyword variant read-json* which will set the various dynamic variables from supplied keywords.
#+begin_src lisp
(read-json* :stream nil
            :eof-error t
            :eof-value nil
            :single-value nil
            :true-value t
            :false-value nil
            :null-value :null
            :array-format :vector
            :object-format :hash-table
            :float-format 'single-float)
#+end_src
Aside from the default mapping, you should keep in mind that shasht will hang if you provide it with nil rather than a json string.

<<shasht-encoding>>
*** Encoding
The primary interface to serializing and writing JSON is the write-json function.
#+begin_src lisp
(write-json value &optional (output-stream t))
#+end_src

On the plus side, shasht was one of two libraries which could encode a pathname or a struct. It also is one of the few libraries that can encode CLOS objects out of the box:
#+begin_src lisp
(shasht:write-json (make-instance 'person))
{
  "NAME": "Sabra",
  "EYE-COLOUR": "brown"
}
#+end_src
As you might expect, plists are treated the same as plain lists and will lose their key-value connections. If you want to use plists, you will need to convert to a hash table first.

There are a number of dynamic variables that will influence the serialization of JSON data.

- common-lisp:*print-pretty* — If true then a simple indentation algorithm will be used.
- \star{}write-indent-string* — The string to use when indenting objects and arrays. Initially set to #\space.
- \star{}write-ascii-encoding* — If true then any non ASCII values will be encoded using Unicode escape sequences. Initially set to nil.
- \star{}write-true-values* — Values that will be written as a true token. Initially set to '(t :true).
- \star{}write-false-values* — Values that will be written as a false token. Initially set to '(nil :false).
- \star{}write-null-values* — Values that will be written as a null token. Initially set to (:null).
- \star{}write-alist-as-object* — If true then undotted assocation lists will be written as an object. Initially set to nil.
- \star{}write-plist-as-object* — If true then property lists will be written as an object. Initially set to nil.

Consider the following:
#+begin_src lisp
  (setf common-lisp:*print-pretty* nil)
  (shasht:write-json '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))))
  [["foo"; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: LIST datum: "bar">.
#+end_src
Now if we set shasht:*write-alist-as-object* t,
#+begin_src lisp
  (setf common-lisp:*print-pretty* nil)
  (setf shasht:*write-alist-as-object* t)
  (shasht:write-json '(("foo" . "bar") ("baz" . ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))))

  {"foo":"bar","baz":{1:[2,3],4:[5,6]}}
#+end_src

The actual serialization of JSON data is done by the generic function print-json-value which can be specialized for additional value types.
#+begin_src lisp
(print-json-value value output-stream)
#+end_src
There is also a keyword variant write-json* which will set the various dynamic variables from supplied keywords.
#+begin_src lisp
(write-json* value :stream t
                   :ascii-encoding nil
                   :true-values '(t :true)
                   :false-values '(nil :false)
                   :null-values '(:null)
                   :empty-array-values '(:empty-array)
                   :empty-object-values '(:empty-object)
                   :alist-as-object nil
                   :plist-as-object nil
                   :pretty nil
                   :indent-string "  ")

#+end_src
In order to facilitate extending the serialization facilities of shasht there are a number of helper functions available. To aid in the printing of JSON strings there is the following.
#+begin_src lisp
(write-json-string value output-stream)
#+end_src
In order to ease the serialization of objects and arrays there is with-json-object and with-json-array. Both of these macros take an output stream as the first argument then enable indentation and automatic handling of all delimiter tokens. Inside the body of with-json-object the function (print-json-key-value key value output-stream) should be used to output a key value pair. Inside the body of with-json-array the function (print-json-value value output-stream) should be used to output a single value. Example usage can be seen in the source code.
<<shasht-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array.
#+begin_src lisp
  (shasht:with-json-array *standard-output*
    (dotimes (i 3)
      (shasht:write-json i)))
  [0,1,2]
#+end_src
One way of doing the second exercise could look like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (shasht:with-json-object *standard-output*
    (shasht:print-json-key-value ()
                                 "hello" "hu hu" *standard-output*)
    (shasht:print-json-key-value ()
                                 "harr"
                                 (loop :for i :from 0 :to 2 :collect i)
                                 ,*standard-output*))
  {"hello": "hu hu", "harr": [0,1,2]}
#+end_src

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, shasht had no issues.

Going from CL->Json->CL was more problematic. The alist input was converted to vectors of vectors and keyword symbols became strings.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. shasht did not exhibit the first issue.

With respect to the second issue, shasht rejected 159 out of 173 malformed test cases. While it did not trigger the stack exhaustion issue exhibited by most of the other packages, some of the malformed json data strings did trigger recoverable error situations.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
shasht accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45] and [123.456e78]

It accepted 9 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.

- (1) You can write a method to handle these
- (2) Only if the alist does not have dotted cons cells.
- (3) Encoding hash-tables works with the caveat that if the hash-table has symbols as keys, you will have to write your own method to handle symbols first.

<<st-json-decoding>>
*** Decoding
In decoding, st-json creates instances of a struct "jso" which wraps an alist. The underlying idea for using a struct is that often hash tables are too heavy weight for the needs.
#+begin_src lisp
  (st-json:read-json "{\"foo\": \"alpha\", \"bar\":3.2,\"baz\": \"null\"}")

  #S(ST-JSON:JSO :ALIST (("foo" . "alpha") ("bar" . 3.2) ("baz" . "null")))
#+end_src
<<st-json-encoding>>
*** Encoding
The basic encoding function is write-json. Similarly to cl-json, st-json has a function for writing json output to string as well as to a stream. St-json has a limited number of lisp datatypes that it handles out of the box. For example, vectors are not included. It is easy to write methods for those types, but that is an additional amount of work not necessary in most of the other libraries.
<<st-json-encoding-symbols>>
**** Encoding Symbols
You need to write your own st-json::write-json-element function for symbols. Possibly something like:
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod st-json:write-json-element ((element symbol) stream)
  (st-json:write-json-element (string element) stream))
#+end_src
You can also write methods to handle encoding the other lisp datatypes in the default mapping table which show an error.
<<st-json-encoding-arrays>>
**** Encoding Arrays
You need to write your own st-json::write-json-element function for arrays. Possibly something like:
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod write-json-element ((element vector) stream)
  (declare #.*optimize*)
  (write-char #\[ stream)
  (loop :for val :across element
          :for first := t :then nil
          :unless first :do (write-char #\, stream)
          :do (write-json-element val stream))
  (write-char #\] stream))
#+end_src
<<st-json-encoding-clos>>
**** Encoding Alists
If the alist has dotted cons cells, jsown and st-json triggered unhandled memory faults with sbcl 2.1.11-x86-64-linux, ccl version 1.12.1 LinuxX8664 and ecl-version 21.2.1. This appears to be because jsown and st-json have optimized the code and assumed that all lists will be proper lists. The assumption obviously fails in the context of dotted cons cells.
**** Encoding CLOS
St-json requires that you actually define a write-json-element method for the CLOS class you want to encode. Consider our little person class.
#+begin_src lisp
(defclass person ()
    ((name
      :initarg :name :initform "Sabra"
      :accessor name)
     (eye-colour :initarg :eye-colour
      :initform "brown"
      :accessor eye-colour)))
#+end_src
Creating the required method for this class is straight forward.
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod st-json:write-json-element ((person person) stream)
  (let ((accessors '(("name" name) ("eye_colour" eye-colour))))
    (write-char  #\{ stream)
    (loop :for (key val) :in accessors
          :for first := t :then nil
          :unless first :do (write-char #\, stream)
          do
          (st-json:write-json-element key stream)
          (write-char #\: stream)
          (st-json:write-json-element (funcall val person) stream))
    (write-char  #\} stream)))

#<STANDARD-METHOD ST-JSON:WRITE-JSON-ELEMENT (PERSON T) {101561B163}>
JSON-TESTS> (let ((data (make-instance 'person))) (st-json:write-json data *standard-output*))
{"name":"Sabra","eye_colour":"brown"}
#+end_src

<<st-json-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array. The first exercise (again, like jsown, I found using loop easier than dotimes):
#+begin_src lisp
(st-json:write-json-to-string
   (loop :for i :from 0 :to 2 :collect i))
"[0,1,2]"
#+end_src
The second exercise:
#+begin_src lisp
  (st-json:write-json-to-string
   (st-json:jso "hello" "hu hu" "harr"
                (loop :for i :from 0 :to 2 :collect i)))

  "{\"hello\":\"hu hu\",\"harr\":[0,1,2]}"
#+end_src
<<st-json-other-information>>

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, st-json had no issues.

Going from CL->Json->CL was more problematic solely because you need to write a method to deal with encoding symbols.
*** Security
There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. st-json did not exhibit the first issue.

With respect to the second issue, st-json rejected 140 out of 173 malformed test cases. Unfortunately it did trigger the stack exhaustion issue exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
st-json accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45], [123.456e78]

It accepted 8 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking
  See [[benchmarking][Benchmarking]]

*** Other Information
St-json provides error conditions for json-type-error, json-parse error, json-error and json-eof-error. These are undocumented, so you will have to look at the source code for how to use them.

*** st-json exported symbols
- *\star{}allow-comments** - Non-nil means ignore comments when parsing.
- *\star{}decode-objects-as** - Valid values: :jso :hashtable
  Controls how js objects should be decoded. :jso means decode to internal struct which
  can be processed by getjso, mapjso etc. :hashtable means decode as hash tables.
- *\star{}output-literal-unicode** - Bind this to T in order to reduce the use of \uXXXX Unicode escapes,
  by emitting literal characters (encoded in UTF-8). This may help
  reduce the parsing effort for any recipients of the JSON output, if
  they can already read UTF-8, or else, they'll need to implement
  complex unicode (eg UTF-16 surrogate pairs) escape parsers.
- *\star{}script-tag-hack** - Bind this to T when writing JSON that will be written to an HTML
  document. It prevents '</script>' from occurring in strings by
  escaping any slash following a '<' character.
- *as-json-bool* - Convert a generalised boolean to a :true/:false keyword.
- *from-json-bool* - Convert :true or :false to its boolean equivalent.
- *getjso* - Fetch a value from a JS object. Returns a second value like gethash.
- *getjso** - The getjso* function in theory allows you to take a key in the form of "a.b.c" and st-json will generate a series of getjso calls to go down each level and return the value for key c. This, however, does not seem to work if read-json does not result in jso objects all the way down. Consider, for example, if we have is a jso object which wraps a cons which wraps a jso object. The intermediary cons prevents getjso* from walking down the nested list.
- *jso* - Create a JS object. Arguments should be alternating labels and values.

- *json-eof-error*
- *json-error*
- *json-null* - (deftype json-null () '(eql :null))
- *json-parse-error*
- *json-type-error*
- *mapjso* - Iterate over the key/value pairs in a JS object.
- *read-json* - Read a JSON-encoded value from a stream or a string.
- *read-json-as-type* - Read a JSON value and assert the result to be of a given type. Raises a json-type-error when the type is wrong.
- *read-json-from-string*
- *write-json* - Write a value's JSON representation to a stream.
- *write-json-element* - Method used for writing values of a specific type. You can specialise this for your own types.

As the website says, trivial-json-codec is a json parser able to handle class hierarchies if the classes have been defined and so long as each class in a hierarchy has at least one slot named differently. It does not handle the difference between json's null and false (everything is nil once it gets to the CL side). The one thing I do not understand is its use of angle brackets when encoding lists to json. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
  (trivial-json-codec:serialize '(1 2 3) *standard-output*)
  <1,2,3>
#+end_src
Encoding vectors looks perfectly standard:
#+begin_src lisp
  (trivial-json-codec:serialize #(1 2 3) *standard-output*)
  [1,2,3]
#+end_src
I see this encoding of lists as resulting in invalid json, but maybe I am missing something.

- (1) You could write a method to handle these
- (2) Using deserialize-raw
- (3) Using deserialize-json if a base class is given

<<trivial-json-codec-decoding>>
*** Decoding
Trivial-json-codec has two functions that "deserialize" json strings. The first is deserialize-raw. Json arrays are converted to vectors and json objects are converted to alists.
#+begin_src lisp
  (trivial-json-codec:deserialize-raw "[1.23,\"alpha\",false,null]")
  #(1.23 "alpha" NIL NIL)

  (trivial-json-codec:deserialize-raw *address-1*)
  ((:NAME "George Washington") (:BIRTHDAY "February 22, 1732")
                               (:ADDRESS "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"))
#+end_src
The second is deserialize-json. This function takes a json string, a CL class, a read-table and constructors. The last three default to nil. If you do not supply a CL class, deserialize-json can only handle native types:
#+begin_src lisp
(trivial-json-codec:deserialize-json "[1.23,\"alpha\",false,null]")
#(1.23 "alpha" NIL NIL)
#+end_src
If you do supply a class, it will try to create an instance of the class with data from the json string. Lets try with our simple person class which only has slots name and eye-colour.
#+begin_src lisp
    (describe
     (trivial-json-codec:deserialize-json "{\"name\":\"Rebecca\",\"eye-colour\":\"blue\"}"
                                          :class (find-class 'person)))
    #<PERSON {1010770303}>
      [standard-object]

    Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
      NAME                           = "Rebecca"
      EYE-COLOUR                     = "blue"
#+end_src
To no one's surprise, if the json string is an array, it will just return a vector. If the array contains the proper json objects, it will return a vector of class objects:
#+begin_src lisp
  (describe
   (aref
    (trivial-json-codec:deserialize-json
     "[{\"name\":\"Rebecca\",\"eye-colour\":\"blue\"}, {\"name\":\"Johann\",\"eye-colour\":\"brown\"}]"
     :class (find-class 'person))
    1))
  #<PERSON {1011E67053}>
  [standard-object]
  Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  NAME                           = "Johann"
  EYE-COLOUR                     = "brown"
#+end_src
If you have a class hierarchy, it will work through the inherited classes. Each class will need to have at least one slot named differently.
<<trivial-json-codec-encoding>>

*** Encoding
Trivial-json-codec has two functions for encoding: serialize and serialize-json. Serialize is the underlying generic function and takes a stream parameter as well as the data. Serialize-json uses serialize and returns a string.
**** Hierarchy Use Case
I am just going to quote from the README here:
#+begin_src lisp

      (trivial-json-codec:serialize-json message))
    => "{ \"UID\" : 2,  \"PAYLOAD\" : { \"VALUE" : \"abc\"}}"

    (deserialize-json "{ \"UID\" : 2,  \"PAYLOAD\" : { \"VALUE" : \"abc\"}}"
      :class (find-class 'Message))
    => This terminates with an error due to non-unique class mapping.
       StringPayload and Simplepayload differ only on the slot's type.
#+end_src

*** Symmetry
From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, trivial-json-codec continued its insistence that json arrays should be shown as angle brackets. trivial-json-codec is really intended as a parser (one way) from json to CL, not really serializing to json.

Interestingly, trivial-json-codec had no problems going from CL->Json->CL.
*** Security
  There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data.  trivial-json-codec did not exhibit the first issue.

  With respect to the second issue, trivial-json-codec rejected 101 out of 173 malformed test cases. It did not trigger the stack exhaustion issue exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
  trivial-json-codec accepted 87 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45], [123.456e78], [[] ], [0e+1], [1E+2], [1e+2], { "min": -1.0e+28, "max": 1.0e+28 }

  It accepted 13 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking
  See [[benchmarking][Benchmarking]]

*** trivial-json-codec exported symbols
- *serialize-json obj* - takes obj and serializes it into a string. uses the generic serialize to do the job.
- *deserialize-json json-str &key (class nil) (read-table nil) (constructors nil)* - reads json-str and creates an according object. If class is non-nil and represents a class, an instance of it is returned. otherwise only built-in types can be deserialized. Read-table makes it possible to inject specific readers, as pondons to serialize. it has the form of an alist containing the dispatch character as car and the deserialization function as cdr. constructors holds an alist mapping the keyword returned by a specific reader to a object construction function.
- *serialize obj stream* - serialize an object obj into stream. implementations for some built-in types already exist. the user might extend with methods for specific types.
- *deserialize-raw json-str &key (read-table nil)* - deserialize json-str into a property list. as opposed to deserialize-json this function does not require a base class to deserialize.

IMPORTANT: Notice the github location has moved. Hans Huebner's old github location will automatically redirect to Phil Marek's, but quicklisp is not (as of the time of this writing) pulling code from the new github location. It is actively maintained by Phil Marek and he is very responsive.

From the author: "the major difference between YASON and the other JSON libraries that were available when I wrote it is that YASON does not require the user to come up with a Lisp data structure that reflects the JSON data structure that should be generated. Rather, I wanted a way to generate JSON directly from my internal data structures.

The reason for that desire was that I had to generate different JSON format in different contexts. That is, a class instance would sometimes be generated including all its attributes, sometimes just with a select set of attributes and sometimes as a reference. Thus, there was no right way to render an object as JSON, and I found the approach to first generate a data structure that would then be rendered as JSON to be wasteful and, as CL has no literal syntax for hash tables, ugly.

Instead of going through an intermediate data structure, YASON allows you to encode to a JSON stream on the fly (<http://common-lisp.net/project/yason/#stream-encoder>."

- (2) Will trigger a no-applicable-method error. So you could write class specific encoding methods for your objects.
- (3) Will return an object. Undotted alists will return values in an array, dotted alists will return individual values for each key. See [[yason-encoding-alists][Yason Encoding Alists]] below.
<<yason-decoding>>
*** Decoding

Yason uses its generic function parse to generate a hash-table of the received json-object. It is possible to set the special variable \star{}parse-object-as* :hash-table, :plist or :alist to specify the data structure that objects are parsed into. The default is :hash-table with test being equal. It is also possible to set the special variable \star{}parse-json-arrays-as-vectors* to t, in which case the json arrays will be parsed as vectors and not as lists.

The following are decoding tests on JSON arrays, arrays in arrays and embedded arrays in an object and the results. I am using the additional yason parameters to show the alist representation instead of a hash-table and to return JSON arrays as vectors rather than lists.

#+begin_src lisp
(defparameter *short-encoded-items-A*

"[\"items\",
  {\"index\":1,
     \"float\":19.2041,
     \"name\":\"Jennifer\",
     \"surname\":\"Snow7\",
     \"fullname\":\"Andrew4 Vaughan\",\"email\":\"sherri@ritchie.zw\",
     \"bool\":null},
   {\"index\":2,
     \"float\":14.9888,\"name\":\"Alfred\",
     \"surname\":\"Pitts\",\"fullname\":\"Barry Weiner\",
     \"email\":\"cheryl@craven.re\",\"bool\":null}]")

(yason:parse *short-encoded-items-A* :json-arrays-as-vectors t :object-as :alist)

'("items"
 (("bool") ("email" . "sherri@ritchie.zw") ("fullname" . "Andrew Vaughan")
 ("surname" . "Snow7") ("name" . "Jennifer") ("float" . 19.2041)
 ("index" . 1))
 (("bool") ("email" . "cheryl@craven.re") ("fullname" . "Barry Weiner")
 ("surname" . "Pitts") ("name" . "Alfred") ("float" . 14.9888)
 ("index" . 2)))
#+end_src

<<yason-nested-json-objects>>
**** Nested JSON Objects

Yason does require that you completely parse the json data instead of being able to filter it while taking it in. Taking the nested JSON object below, how could we get a information out of the innermost nested object?

#+begin_src javascript
{
  "items": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "integer": 29,
      "float": 16.8278,
      "fullname": "Milton Jensen",
      "bool": false
    }
  ]
}
#+end_src
You need to know your data structure so that you can figure out how to walk the tree. How would we get the value of the key "integer"? Looking at it, it is a JSON object which keyword "items"contains an array which contains a JSON object.

By default, yason decodes json objects to hash-tables and arrays into lists. So we can descend the parsed json tree in this particular example something like this (assuming the json object was in a file named json4.txt):
#+begin_src lisp
  (gethash "integer"
           (first
            (gethash "items"
                     (yason:parse
                      (alexandria:read-file-into-string #P"/home/sabra/json4.txt")))))

  29
#+end_src
<<yason-encoding>>
*** Encoding
The base yason encoding function is encode, which takes some data and an optional stream, defaulting to \star{}standard-output*. It returns first the json-encoded item and second the lisp item:
#+begin_src lisp
(yason:encode '("a" 1 "b" 2))
["a",1,"b",2]
("a" 1 "b" 2)
#+end_src
Yason has multiple specialized methods that may be required, depending on the data structure to be encoded. For example:
yason:encode-alist, yason:encode-plist, yason:encode-object, etc. The following demonstrates that providing a plist to yason:encode results in an json array, but providing a plist to yason:encode-plist results in a json object.
#+begin_src lisp
  (yason:encode '("a" 1 "b" 2))
  ["a",1,"b",2]

  (yason:encode-plist '("a" 1 "b" 2))
  {"a":1,"b":2}
#+end_src

<<yason-encoding-symbols>>
**** Encoding Symbols
The version of yason in quicklisp as of this writing (version 7.8) has no applicable method for encoding a symbol. This also means that  by default, yason will not encode lists with symbols. That is resolved in version 8.2 on github, but for some reason it is not getting picked up in quicklisp. You can resolve this in version 7.8 by writing a new method to handle symbols. Such a method could look like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod encode ((object symbol) &optional (stream *json-output*))
    (let ((new (funcall #'ENCODE-SYMBOL-AS-LOWERCASE object)))
      (assert (stringp new))
      (encode new stream)))
#+end_src
If you have symbols in alists as keys, you can (setf yason:*symbol-key-encoder* 'yason:ENCODE-SYMBOL-AS-LOWERCASE) and then yason:encode-alist will work, but not yason:encode.
#+begin_src lisp
(yason:encode-alist '((a 1) (b 2)))
{"a":[1],"b":[2]}
((A 1) (B 2))
#+end_src
<<yason-encoding-alists>>
**** Encoding Alists
Unlike some other libraries, yason's encode-alist function handles both dotted and undotted alists. It will return an object. The values in undotted alists will be returned as arrays, the values in dotted alists will be returned as individual values. As mentioned in just above in dealing with symbols, if you have symbols as keys in your alist, you need to have set \star{}symbol-key-encoder* to 'yason:ENCODE-SYMBOL-AS-LOWERCASE in order to make them usable without triggering errors.
#+begin_src lisp
  (setf yason:*symbol-key-encoder* 'yason:ENCODE-SYMBOL-AS-LOWERCASE)

  (yason:encode-alist '((a 1 2 3 4) (b 5 6 7)))
  {"a":[1,2,3,4],"b":[5,6,7]}

  (yason:encode-alist '((a . 1) (b . 2)))
  {"a":1,"b":2}
#+end_src

<<yason-encoding-clos>>
**** Encoding CLOS
For objects, you will have to write your own method to extend yason to encode objects using the generic functions encode-object and encode-slots or encode-object-slots. Taking our simple person class, we can define a new encode-slots, then within an output context, we can call encode-object and output the clos class instance.
#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod yason:encode-slots progn ((person person))
    (yason:encode-object-slots person '(name eye-colour)))

  (yason:with-output-to-string* ()
    (yason:encode-object (make-instance 'person)))
  "{\"NAME\":\"Sabra\",\"EYE-COLOUR\":\"brown\"}"
#+end_src
Or you can take a look at [[json-mop][json-mop]] or [[herodotus][herodotus]]. I have a preference for json-mop with the caveat that, at the moment, you cannot redefine classes.
<<yason-incremental>>
**** Incremental Encoding
The following examples use two exercises. First, incrementally build a json array. Second, incrementally build a json object which also contains an incrementally built json array.
#+begin_src lisp
	(yason:with-output (*standard-output*)
		(yason:with-array ()
			(dotimes (i 3)
				(yason:encode-array-element i))))
	[0,1,2]
#+end_src
#+begin_src lisp
	(yason:with-output (*standard-output*)
		(yason:with-object ()
			(yason:encode-object-element "hello" "hu hu")
			(yason:with-object-element ("harr")
				(yason:with-array ()
					(dotimes (i 3)
						(yason:encode-array-element i))))))
	{"hello":"hu hu","harr":[0,1,2]}
#+end_src
*** Symmetry
      From the standpoint of symmetry or round-tripping, going from Json->CL->Json, yason had no issues.
      Going from CL->Json->CL was more problematic solely because keyword symbols were written to strings and :NULL was converted to nil.
*** Security
  There were two general security issues we considered: (1) interning keywords and (2) issues with malformed data. yason did not exhibit the first issue.

  With respect to the second issue, yason rejected 119 out of 173 malformed test cases. Unfortunately it did trigger the stack exhaustion issue exhibited by most of the other packages.
*** Conformity with Json Standard
  yason accepted 92 of the 95 test cases that are considered "must accept". It failed to accept: [123e65], [123e45], [123.456e78],
  It accepted 8 of the 17 test cases considered to be part of the gray area of the json specification - you could accept or reject.
*** Benchmarking

*** yason exported symbols
- *\star{}list-encoder** - function to call to translate a cl list into json data. 'yason:encode-plain-list-to-array is the default; 'yason:encode-plist and 'yason:encode-alist are available to produce json objects. this is useful to translate a deeply recursive structure in a single yason:encode call.
- *\star{}parse-json-arrays-as-vectors** - if set to a true value, json arrays will be parsed as vectors, not as lists. nil is the default.
- *\star{}parse-json-booleans-as-symbols** - if set to a true value, json booleans will be read as the symbols true and false instead of t and nil, respectively. nil is the default.
- *\star{}parse-json-null-as-keyword** - if set to a true value, json null will be read as the keyword :null, instead of nil. nil is the default.
- *\star{}parse-object-as** - can be set to :hash-table to parse objects as hash tables, :alist to parse them as alists or :plist to parse them as plists. :hash-table is the default.
- *\star{}parse-object-as-alist**
- *\star{}parse-object-key-fn** - function to call to convert a key string in a json object to a key in the cl hash produced. identity is the default.
- *\star{}symbol-encoder** - warning: as of the time of this writing, this variable is in version 0.8.2 on github and not in version 0.7.8 in quicklisp. function to call to translate a cl symbol into a json string. the default is to error out, to provide backwards-compatible behaviour. a useful function that can be bound to this variable is yason:encode-symbol-as-lowercase
- *\star{}symbol-key-encoder*- defines the policy to encode symbols as keys (eg. in hash tables). the default is to error out, to provide backwards-compatible behaviour. a useful function that can be bound to this variable is yason:encode-symbol-as-lowercase
- *encode* - encode object in json format and write to stream. may be specialized by applications to perform specific rendering. stream defaults to \star{}standard-output*.
- *encode-alist* - encodes object, an alist, in json format and write to stream.
- *encode-array-element* - encode object as next array element to the last json array opened with with-array in the dynamic context. object is encoded using the encode generic function, so it must be of a type for which an encode method is defined.
- *encode-array-elements* - encode objects, a series of json encodable objects, as the next array elements in a json array opened with with-array. encode-array-elements uses encode-array-element, which must be applicable to each object in the list (i.e. encode must be defined for each object type). additionally, this must be called within a valid stream context.
- *encode-object* - generic function to encode an object. the default implementation opens a new object encoding context and calls encode-slots on the argument.
- *encode-object-element* - encode key and value as object element to the last json object opened with with-object in the dynamic context. key and value are encoded using the encode generic function, so they both must be of a type for which an encode method is defined.
- *encode-object-elements* - encodes the parameters into json in the last object opened with with-object using encode-object-element. the parameters should consist of alternating key/value pairs, and this must be called within a valid stream context.
- *encode-object-slots* - encodes each slot in slots for object in the last object opened with with-object using encode-object-element. the key is the slot name, and the value is the slot value for the slot on object.
- *encode-plain-list-to-array*
- *encode-plist* - encodes object, a plist, in json format and write to stream.
- *encode-slots* - generic function to encode object slots. there is no default implementation. it should be called in an object encoding context. it uses progn combinatation with most-specific-last order, so that base class slots are encoded before derived class slots.
- *encode-symbol-as-lowercase*
- *false*
- *make-json-output-stream* - creates a json-output-stream instance that wraps the supplied stream and optionally performs indentation of the generated json data. the indent argument is described in with-output. note that if the indent argument is nil, the original stream is returned in order to avoid the performance penalty of the indentation algorithm.
- *no-json-output-context* - this condition is signalled when one of the stream encoding functions is used outside the dynamic context of a with-output or with-output-to-string* body.
- *null*
- *parse* - input &key (object-key-fn \star{}parse-object-as-key-fn*) (object-as \star{}parse-object-as*) (json-arrays-as-vectors \star{}parse-json-arrays-as-vectors*) (json-booleans-as-symbols \star{}parse-json-booleans-as-symbols*) (json-nulls-as-keyword \star{}parse-json-null-as-keyword*) => object parse input, which must be a string or a stream, as json. returns the lisp representation of the json structure parsed. the keyword arguments object-key-fn, object-as, json-arrays-as-vectors, json-booleans-as-symbols, and json-null-as-keyword may be used to specify different values for the parsing parameters from the current bindings of the respective special variables.
- *true*
- *with-array* - open a json array, then run body. inside the body, encode-array-element must be called to encode elements to the opened array. must be called within an existing json encoder context (see with-output and with-output-to-string*)
- *with-object* - open a json object, then run body. inside the body, encode-object-element or with-object-element must be called to encode elements to the object. must be called within an existing json encoder with-output and with-output-to-string*.
- *with-object-element* -  open a new encoding context to encode a json object element. key is the key of the element. the value will be whatever body serializes to the current json output context using one of the stream encoding functions. this can be used to stream out nested object structures.
- *with-output* - macro: set up a json streaming encoder context on stream, then evaluate body. indent can be set to t to enable indentation with a default indentation width or to an integer specifying the desired indentation width. by default, indentation is switched off.
- *with-output-to-string** - set up a json streaming encoder context on stream-symbol (by default a gensym), then evaluate body. return a string with the generated json output. see with-output for the description of the indent keyword argument.

| Library        | Author    | License | Website  | Works With | Comments                |
|----------------+-----------+---------+----------+------------+-------------------------|
| [[cl-json-helper][cl-json-helper]] | Bob Felts | BSD     | [[https://github.com/stablecross/cl-json-helper][homepage]] | cl-json    | Last updated 2018       |

cl-json-helper is a very small package that adds two functions to help cl-json encoding JSON data and one function to help in processing decoded JSON data. I will use its nickname :xjson in the examples. At the end of the day, I see a slight benefit here, but given that it is really just a cl-json helper and the latest generation of json libraries have passed cl-json by, I think this is only for cl-json devotees.

*** cl-json-helper exported symbols
- *json-bool* - (json-bool val) returns an object that cl-json will decode to "true" or "false"
- *json-empty* - (json-empty) returns an object that cl-json will decode to '{}'
- *json-key-value* - (json-key-value key list) returns the value associated with key
- *value-of*
*** Json-bool
json-bool simply adds the ability for nil to be translated to json as false.
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:encode-json-to-string '(t nil))
  "[true,null]"

  (cl-json:encode-json-to-string `(,(xjson:json-bool t) ,(xjson:json-bool nil)))
  "[true,false]"
#+end_src
*** json-empty
json-empty provides the ability to return an empty object. E.g.
#+begin_src lisp
(cl-json:encode-json-to-string `(("Empty" . ,(xjson:json-empty))))
"{\"Empty\":{}}"
#+end_src
*** Json-key-value
If cl-json:decode-json-from-string \star{}nested-address-1* looks like this:
#+begin_src lisp
  (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*)
  ((:FIRST--NAME . "George") (:LAST--NAME . "Washington")
   (:BIRTHDAY . "1732-02-22")
   (:ADDRESS (:STREET--ADDRESS . "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway")
    (:CITY . "Mount Vernon") (:STATE . "Virginia") (:COUNTRY . "United States")))
#+end_src
Then you can access the address using cl-json-helper
#+begin_src lisp
(xjson:json-key-value :address (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*))
((:STREET--ADDRESS . "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway")
 (:CITY . "Mount Vernon") (:STATE . "Virginia") (:COUNTRY . "United States"))
#+end_src
The only difference between using this and using (assoc ..) is that assoc will also keep the key:
#+begin_src lisp
(assoc :address (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *nested-address-1*))
(:ADDRESS (:STREET--ADDRESS . "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway")
 (:CITY . "Mount Vernon") (:STATE . "Virginia") (:COUNTRY . "United States"))

| [[define-json-expander][define-json-expander]] | Johan Sjölén     | MIT          | [[https://github.com/ejbs/define-json-expander][homepage]] | cl-json    |      Last updated 2014               |

Define-json-expander is, I think, something interesting to look at, but I do not see it adding a great deal of value. Given the last time it was updated was eight years ago, I think it is of historical interest only.
*** define-json-expander exported symbols
- \star{}accessor-prefix*
- define-json-expander

*** Explanation
Let's take our simplest json object address example which we keep in *address-1*:
#+begin_src javascript
"{
  \"name\": \"George Washington\",
  \"birthday\": \"February 22, 1732\",
  \"address\": \"Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States\"
}"
#+end_src
We now use define-json-expander to create an address class that can be used:
#+begin_src lisp
(define-json-expander:define-json-expander address-class ()
 ((name) (birthday) (address)))
DECODE-ADDRESS
#+end_src
Now we have a decode-address function that we can apply to a cl-json decoded json string:
#+begin_src lisp
  (decode-address-class  (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *address-1*))

(describe (decode-address-class  (cl-json:decode-json-from-string *address-1*)))
#<ADDRESS-CLASS {100D67F9E3}>
  [standard-object]

Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  REST                           = NIL
  NAME                           = "George Washington"
  BIRTHDAY                       = "February 22, 1732"
  ADDRESS                        = "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"
#+end_src
HOWEVER, as far as I can tell, the only accessor or reader method defined is for REST, which has a nil value. Net result, even after reading the docs and the test cases in the source files, I'm confused on whether this is fully baked. Given the last update was 8 years ago, I would give this a pass.

<<herodotus>>
** herodotus
| Library   | Author       | License | Website  | Works With | Comments                                                |

| [[herodotus][herodotus]] | Henry Steere | BSD (1) | [[https://github.com/HenryS1/herodotus][homepage]] | yason      | Wrapper around yason to handle CLOS classes more easily. Last updated 16 Jun 2021 |

Yason does the json parsing and serialisation for herodotus. The other dependencies are cl-ppcre and alexandria. I think it may be useful if you are a yason user.

*** herodotus exported symbols
- *define-json-model*
- *to-json*

*** Setup
Let's make an anologue of our simple person class with herodotus:
#+begin_src lisp
(herodotus:define-json-model herodotus-person (name eye-colour) :snake-case)
#+end_src
This creates a package name HERODOTUS-PERSON-JSON with a function for parsing json HERODOTUS-PERSON-JSON:FROM-JSON and a generic method for writing to json. It has accessors and initargs of name and eye-colour. The created class only has accessor and initarg specs for the slots; it does not have the ability to create default values. That last value specifies that it expects json keys to be using snake-case. (The default is :camel-case, the other options are :snake-case, :kebab-case or :screaming-snake-case.)

From the README:
"The define-json-model macro takes three arguments: name, slots and an optional argument for case-type. The name argument is the name of the generated CLOS class. The slots argument is a collection of slot descriptors and the case-type argument is a keyword.

Slot descriptors can be either symbols or lists. If a slot descriptor is a symbol then the value of the corresponding CLOS slot will be a deserialised json primitive in lisp form: a number, boolean, string, vector (for arrays), or hash-table (for objects).

If a slot descriptor is a list then first argument is the CLOS slot name, the second argument is either () or the name of a previously defined json model to deserialise the value of this field to. The optional third argument is a special case name for this field which can have custom formatting."
*** Decoding
At this point a simple json object could then be decoded into a herodotus-person instance.
#+begin_src lisp
  (eye-colour
   (herodotus-person-json:from-json "{\"name\":\"Claudia\",\"eye_colour\":\"blue\"}"))
  "blue"
#+end_src
If the json object key was "eye-colour" instead of "eye_colour", the return value would have been nil because the case would have been wrong.

If you have an array of json objects, the from-json function would return a vector of herodotus-person objects:
#+begin_src lisp
  (name
   (aref
    (herodotus-person-json:from-json
     "[{\"name\":\"Rebecca\",\"eye_colour\":\"blue\"},{\"name\":\"Johann\",\"eye_colour\":\"brown\"}]")
    1))
  "Johann"
#+end_src
*** Encoding
Encoding usage looks much like yason:
#+begin_src lisp
(herodotus:to-json (make-instance 'herodotus-person :eye-colour "Green" :name "Persephone"))
"{\"name\":\"Persephone\",\"eye_colour\":\"Green\"}"
#+end_src
*** Additional Info
From the README

**** Nested classes

You can also define classes that have class members using the type specifier syntax. This block defines two json models tree and branch. A tree has branch members and the branch members will be parsed from json using the parser defined for the tree.
#+begin_src lisp
CL-USER> (herodotus:define-json-model branch (size))
CL-USER> (herodotus:define-json-model tree ((branches branch)))
#+end_src

The syntax (branches branch) declares that the field named branches must be parsed as the type branch. Json models for nested classes need to be defined before the models for the classes they are nested in or an error will be thrown. The error is thrown at macro expansion time.
#+begin_src lisp
CL-USER> (herodotus:define-json-model test-no-parser ((things not-parseable)))
CL-USER> (herodotus:define-json-model test-no-parser ((things not-parseable)))
class-name TEST-NO-PARSER slots ((THINGS NOT-PARSEABLE))
; Evaluation aborted on #<SIMPLE-ERROR "Could not find parser for
; class NOT-PARSEABLE. Please define a json model for it."
; {100599D903}>.

#+end_src

**** None, one or many semantics

Fields in class definitions are parsed as either nil (if missing from the json), a single instance if the field is not an array and isn’t empty or a vector if the json contains an array of elements.
#+begin_src lisp
CL-USER> (herodotus:define-json-model numbers (ns))
CL-USER> (ns (numbers-json:from-json "{ }"))
NIL
CL_USER> (ns (numbers-json:from-json "{ \"ns\": 1 }"))
1
CL-USER> (ns (numbers-json:from-json "{ \"ns\": [1, 2, 3] }"))
#(1 2 3)
#+end_src

**** Special case field names

Parsing specific field names can be done using the third argument of a field specifier. If a special field name is provided it doesn’t have to match the name of the slot in the CLOS class and can use any formatting convention.
#+begin_src lisp
(herodotus:define-json-model special-case ((unusual-format () "A_very-UniqueNAME"))
(unusual-format (special-case-json:from-json "{ \"A_very-UniqueNAME\": \"Phineas Fog\" }"))
"Phineas Fog"
(herodotus:to-json (special-case-json:from-json "{ \"A_very-UniqueNAME\": \"Phineas Fog\" }"))
"{\"A_very-UniqueNAME\":\"Phineas Fog\"}"
#+end_src

| [[json-mop][json-mop]]             | Grim Schjetne    | MIT          | [[https://github.com/gschjetne/json-mop][homepage]] | yason      |  Last updated 9 Mar 2021                   |

Unlike [[herodotus][herodotus]] which creates a new package, json-mop wants you to define your classes with the class option
#+begin_src lisp
  (:metaclass json-serializable-class)
#+end_src
I quite like json-mop (assuming I was using yason), but you do need to watch for one issue: At the moment you cannot redefine a class. The issue has been flagged twice on github and I ran into it in testing.

For slots that you want to appear in the JSON representation of your class, add the slot option :json-key with the string to use as the attribute name. The option :json-type defaults to :any, but you can control how each slot value is transformed to and from JSON with one of the following JSON type specifiers:
    | Type        | Remarks                                                                                                |
    |-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | :any        | Guesses the way to encode and decode the value                                                         |
    | :string     | Enforces a string value                                                                                |
    | :number     | Enforces a number value                                                                                |
    | :hash-table | Enforces a hash table value                                                                            |
    | :vector     | Enforces a vector value                                                                                |
    | :list       | Enforces a list value                                                                                  |
    | :bool       | Maps T and NIL with true and false                                                                     |
    | <symbol>    | Uses a (:metaclass json-serializable-class) class definition to direct the transformation of the value |
so taking our minimal person object and following these instructions:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defclass mop-person ()
    ((name
      :initarg :name :initform "Sabra" :json-key "name" :json-type :string
      :accessor name)
     (eye-colour :initarg :eye-colour :json-key "eye-colour" :json-type :string
                 :initform "brown"
                 :accessor eye-colour))
    (:metaclass json-mop:json-serializable-class))
  #<JSON-MOP:JSON-SERIALIZABLE-CLASS JSON-TESTS::MOP-PERSON>

  (json-mop:encode (make-instance 'mop-person))
  {"name":"Sabra","eye-colour":"brown"}
#+end_src
We can get a CLOS instance out of an appropriate json object with (json-to-clos data class-name)
#+begin_src lisp
  (describe (json-mop:json-to-clos "{\"name\":\"Karla\",\"eye-colour\":\"green\"}"
                                   'mop-person))
  #<MOP-PERSON {1009BE24B3}>
  [standard-object]

  Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  NAME                           = "Karla"
  EYE-COLOUR                     = "green"
#+end_src

It gets interesting when you create an instance with an invalid data type. Suppose we create a mop-person with a list for a name and an integer for an eye colour. The instance gets created that way, but when we try to encode it, we get an errro:
#+begin_src lisp
  (json-mop:encode (make-instance 'mop-person :name '(1 2 3) :eye-colour 12))
  {

    There is no class named :STRING.
       [Condition of type SB-PCL:CLASS-NOT-FOUND-ERROR]
#+end_src
If the json object actually has a null value for eye-colour, that will be treated as an unbound slot. Our mop-person class has an initform of "brown" for eye-colour and our initform will overrule the json null:
#+begin_src lisp
(describe (json-mop:json-to-clos "{\"name\":\"Andre\",\"eye-colour\":null}"  'mop-person))
#<MOP-PERSON {1009C0C693}>
  [standard-object]

Slots with :INSTANCE allocation:
  NAME                           = "Andre"
  EYE-COLOUR                     = "brown"
#+end_src

The README has an example of nested objects:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defclass book ()
    ((title :initarg :title
            :json-type :string
            :json-key "title")

- (1) There is an outstanding issue asking for com.inuoe.jzon support opened on May 14, 2021, but no action.

I am going to borrow 40ants review [[https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/08/0158-cl-json-pointer.html][here]]:

This library implements [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901][RFC 6901]] - a format for accessing nested JSON data-structures. It some sense, JSON pointer is similar to JSON path, but more suitable for use as a part of the URL fragment.

cl-json-pointer's README provides many examples, but all of them are applied to the object which almost flat. Let's try to reproduce an example from the JSON path's site:
#+begin_src javascript
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName" : "doe",
  "age"      : 26,
  "address"  : {
    "streetAddress": "naist street",
    "city"         : "Nara",
    "postalCode"   : "630-0192"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type"  : "iPhone",
      "number": "0123-4567-8888"
    },
    {
      "type"  : "home",
      "number": "0123-4567-8910"
    }
  ]
}
#+end_src
Now we'll translate this JSON path: $.phoneNumbers[0].type into JSON pointer /phoneNumbers/0/type:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defparameter *obj*
    (jsown:parse
     (alexandria:read-file-into-string "data.json")))

  (cl-json-pointer:get-by-json-pointer *obj* "/phoneNumbers/0/type"
                                       :flavor :jsown)
  "iPhone"
  ("type" . "iPhone")
  NIL
#+end_src
It is also possible to add/set/delete elements using cl-json-pointer.

You will find more examples in the official [[https://github.com/y2q-actionman/cl-json-pointer][docs]].

Comparing to the JSON path, the pointer has clearer character escaping rules and is able to work with keys containing dots and slashes and other symbols. But it does not support slicing and some other features of the JSON path.

Per [[https://json-schema.org/][https://json-schema.org/]], Json Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate json documents. Json-schema is an attempt to go from json schema to clos class definition. The intended sequel, [[https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2/][https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2/]], has not been really developed. The author's description on a reddit post found [[https://old.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/pbpa9o/create_clos_classes_from_jsonschema/][here]] was "It is bad. It should only be used to learn and do things better. I don't feel comfortable providing any form of support for this hack. But if you have a directory on the filesystem with some JSON schema in it, you should be able to use the macro json-schema2:define-schema-spec and list the pathname in there. You might get lucky and find everything you need is supported when you view the macroexpansion."

The sum total of documentation for cl-json-schema is the following: The main entrypoint is (cl-json-schema:validate thing schema) where thing is a JSON-compatible value, and schema is a hash-table. (Alternatively, if you prefer, (json-schema:validate thing schema).

For example
#+begin_src lisp
(let ((schema (yason:parse "{
  \"type\": \"object\",
  \"propertyNames\": {
    \"pattern\": \"^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$\"
  }
}
")))
  ;; NEAT!
  (json-schema:validate (yason:parse "{\"_a_proper_token_001\": \"value\"}")
                        schema)
  ;; NO BUENO! Key does not match the required pattern
  (json-schema:validate (yason:parse "{\"001 invalid\": \"value\"}")
                        schema))
#+end_src

* Appendix
<<json-refresher>>
** Json Refresher
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, codified in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259][RFC 8259]]. JSON has the following data structures:

-  object:     { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
-  array:     [ "first", "second", "third" ]
-  number:    42, 3.1415926 (note that there is no separate type for integer or floating point).
-  string:    "This is a string"
-  boolean:    true,    false
-  null:    null

Json objects can be nested, potentially creating the need for a json schema. Taking an example from [[https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about.html][https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about.html]], we can see two json objects containing information about a person:
#+begin_src javascript
{
  "name": "George Washington",
  "birthday": "February 22, 1732",
  "address": "Mount Vernon, Virginia, United States"
}

{
  "first_name": "George",
  "last_name": "Washington",
  "birthday": "1732-02-22",
  "address": {
    "street_address": "3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway",
    "city": "Mount Vernon",
    "state": "Virginia",
    "country": "United States"
  }
}
#+end_src
If you wanted to validate the json objects, you would need a schema which you could check against the objects. The first object would fail validation and the second object would pass validation if they were validate against the following schema:
#+begin_src javascrip
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "first_name": { "type": "string" },
    "last_name": { "type": "string" },
    "birthday": { "type": "string", "format": "date" },
    "address": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street_address": { "type": "string" },
        "city": { "type": "string" },
        "state": { "type": "string" },
        "country": { "type" : "string" }
      }
    }
  }
}
